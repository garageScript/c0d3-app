# Why Learn JS?

JavaScript is the only language that lets you build applications for any
technology platform. The goal of the curriculum is to give you exercises to help
you understand technology at a conceptual level first, end to end:

1. Client side - mobile apps, websites, terminal UI, etc.
2. Server side - Database interactions, system design and optimizations
3. Batch - ML models and scripting

Once you understand these moving parts conceptually, you will be well prepared
to specialize in domain specific languages that optimizes for each task as you
gain more experience as a software engineer.

# Overview

Before starting, please make sure you know some math!

[Numbers Math](https://www.notion.so/Numbers-Math-b1fc634eccd540d6b8ed35cbcd98bf7b)

This will be the extent of how much you will need to know math. If you find any
of the exercises challenging, ask in person at a meetup group or in the
chatroom!

In this lesson, you will learn the fundamental building blocks of coding:

- First, we will cover **variables**, which is how computers store information.
- Then, we will cover some simple data (**primitive** **data types**) that
  computers can store into variables.
- Armed with some knowledge about data, we will talk about a data's **truthy**
  and **falsey** properties and when these matter.
- Lastly, we will dive into more complex data types like **functions**.

There will be many exercises; be sure to solve each problem by yourself first
before looking at the answer! If these concepts are new to you, please go
through the exercises in this lesson over and over again until you are confident
before continuing to the next lesson.

## How to Follow Along

**For experienced coders** - If you already know some JavaScript and wish to
skip directly to the challenges, please at least glance through the materials
covered to make sure you are not missing anything.

The instructions for submitting challenges are at the end of this document.

### Setup Instructions

Before starting, make sure you successfully follow the steps in
[**Setup Instructions**](https://www.notion.so/garagescript/Setup-Instructions-fc8f8fcc1376482ead839fa6b1034cb4).

For all the code examples provided, you should be writing and running the code
yourself to help you understand what the computer is doing. If the concept is
new to you, do not copy and paste. You will learn better if you write out the
code. Write the code into a file, then run the file with `node` (Node is an
application that understands your JavaScript file and runs it).

# Variables

If you imagine yourself doing inventory work and you have to count 20,000 items,
you will need to take a break at some point and write down where you stopped,
right? The act of storing information into your notes is equivalent to storing
data into a variable in the computer world. To do this in JavaScript, we use the
`=` assignment operator which assigns a value to the variable.

An **operator** is a symbol or a set of symbols that does something to the data
on either side of it. The assignment operator, `=`, means the left side takes
the value of the right side.

Examples:

```jsx
marvin = 0 // marvin is a variable, which stores the number 0
// console.log(marvin)
marvin = 42 // what is the value of marvin?
// console.log(marvin)

/*
The computer will ignore
EVERYTHING 
in here!
*/

hands = 89 // what is the value of hands?
// console.log(hands)
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
marvin = 0
marvin = 42 // marvin is 42
hands = 89 // hands is 89
```

</Spoiler>

The computer will ignore everything that comes after the `//` symbol and
everything within the `/*... */` symbol. Software engineers use these symbols to
write **comments** in their code. Comments explain complicated code so that
other engineers can read and understand the code better.

> If you want to check a variable's value, you can use `console.log`. Remove the
> comment from the `console.log` lines in the example above and you will be able
> to see the output when you run the file. There's no need to understand
> `console.log` now; it is explained later.

## Best Practice

Good practice means practicing good habits to become a good software engineer.
Bad practice means practicing bad habits that will negatively impact you as a
software engineer. Best practice means that you should **always** practice this
habit because all good software engineers have this habit.

In the above example, we are creating variables like this: `marvin = 0`. Even
though it works, it is considered **bad practice** because the variable
overwrites the global scope (you will naturally understand why after you start
coding, so don't worry if the reason does not make sense). Instead, you should
use `const` or `let` (explained below).

### const

`const` stands for **constant**. Use `const` to declare a variable when you
never need to change its value, like the following example:

```jsx
const points = 5
const res = points + 2
```

**Incorrect**: If you use `const` to declare a variable and then try to change
its value, you will get an error.

```jsx
const points = 5
points = 7 // ERROR
// TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'points'
```

### let

If you need to declare a variable and you might need to change its value later,
you should use `let`.

```jsx
let points = 5
points = 7
```

As a rule of thumb, always use `const` until you can't!

# Primitive Data

Variables can store all kinds of data. In this section we will be exploring 3
types of primitive data: **Number, String,** and **Boolean**. If you are
wondering why they are called primitive data, it will make complete sense when
you learn about non-primitive data (in lesson 2 about Arrays). For now, just
know that **Number, String,** and **Boolean** are primitive data.

## Number

Number allows you to work with numbers and can be manipulated using operators
such as

`+, - , *, /` (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division). Let's start
with a few examples:

```jsx
const fi = 5 // what is the value of fi?
const mission = fi + 1 // what is the value of mission?
const deed = fi + mission // what is the value of deed?
const space = 8 * 8 // what is the value of space?
const ship = space / 4 // what is the value of ship?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fi = 5 // 5
const mission = fi + 1 // 6
const deed = fi + mission // 11
const space = 8 * 8 // 64
const ship = space / 4 // 16
```

</Spoiler>

One commonly used operator is `%` (Modulus or Division Remainder), which gives
you the remainder when you divide 2 numbers. For example: `14 % 7` is `0`
because 14 divided by 7 has a remainder of 0. `13 % 7` is `6` because 13 divided
by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 6.

_If it has been a long time since you did division, there is an easy way to get
the correct result. When you see `a % b`, simply keep subtracting `b` from `a`
until you get a result smaller than `b`. For example:_

`towel = 18 % 7`: towel is the remainder

18-7 is 11, which is greater than 7, so we subtract again!

11 - 7 is 4, which is smaller than 7, so we have arrived at our answer. `18 % 7`
is 4.

`towel` has the value 4.

```jsx
let rem = 15 % 3 // What is the value of rem?
rem = 15 % 7 // What is the value of rem?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let rem = 15 % 3 // 0
rem = 15 % 7 // 1
```

 </Spoiler>

## Strings

A string can be words, sentences, or a bunch of characters. To make a string,
you can use double quotes `"` , single quotes `'`, or backticks
```(the key to the left of 1 on most keyboards). It does not matter which of these 3 symbols you use to create a string, but you cannot mix the symbols, like`"xxx'`. You must terminate the string with the same symbol you started it with: `"xxx"`.

> Make sure you never confuse yourself between strings and variables!

```jsx
const hello = 'I have 500 bucks'
let a = 'hello' // what is the value of a?
a = hello // What is the value of a since we didn't use quotes?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const hello = 'I have 500 bucks'
let a = 'hello' // "hello"
a = hello // "I have 500 bucks"
```

Strings without quotes are variables!

</Spoiler>

For now, you only need to know one operator for strings, which is `+`, used to
join strings together. For example, `'End ' + 'Game'` results in `'End Game'`.

If you encounter a variable, make sure you don't treat it like a string.

```jsx
const a = 'hello'
const message = a + 'world' // what is value of message?
const c = 5
const d = c + message // what is the value of d?
const e = '<h1>' + a + '</h1>' // what is the value of e?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const a = 'hello'
const message = a + 'world' // "helloworld"
const c = 5
const d = c + message // "5helloworld"
const e = '<h1>' + a + '</h1>' // "<h1>hello</h1>"

// Explanation for the previous example: d = c + message
/* 
Let's try to think from a computer's perspective:

c has a value of 5
message has a value of "helloworld"

so const d = c + message means
d takes the value of c and join with the value of message
Hence, d gets the value of 5 + "helloworld" which is "5helloworld".

What is 5 + "helloworld"?
The computer knows how to add number + number, or string + string.

Can I convert "helloworld" to a number? No.
Can I convert 5 to a string? Yes. "5"

Therefore, let's convert and add: "5" + "helloworld"

"5helloworld"
*/
```

</Spoiler>

Sometimes, you might find yourself adding many variables together with strings.
For example, imagine this scenario:

```jsx
const firstName = 'Tony'
const lastName = 'Stark'
const location = 'Paris'
const message =
  'Welcome to ' + location + ', ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '!'
// the variable message takes the value: "Welcome to Paris, Tony Stark!"
```

## Template Literals (Template Strings)

Try typing the variable message out like the example above, and you will realize
how painful it is. Therefore, using `+` with strings is not common.

We can use ```(backticks) and`${expression}` (placeholder) instead, which allows
us to put the variables directly into the string:

```jsx
const message = `Welcome to ${location}, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`
// Notice how much shorter it is than:
//    message = "Welcome to " + location + ', ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '!'
```

**Exercise:** Rewrite the `story` variable to use ```

```jsx
const actor = 'We'
const location = "farmers' market"

const story = actor + ' plan to go to a ' + location + ' tomorrow'

// task: Rewrite the above story variable using ` (backticks) or template literals.
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const actor = 'We'
const location = "farmers' market"
const story = `${actor} plan to go to a ${location} tomorrow`
```

</Spoiler>

## Boolean

Booleans can be either of 2 values: `true` or `false`. **Operators** like `===`
(is equal to), `!==` (is not equal to), `>` (is greater than), and `<` (is
smaller than) are used to compare the left side with the right side.

The **comparison operators** compare two pieces of data and give a boolean value
of true or false. For example:

- `"hello" === "hello"` is `true`
- `5 > 2` is `true`, because 5 is greater than 2
- `9 < 2` is `false`, because 9 is not smaller than 2

```jsx
const lupin = 5 === 5 // what is the value of lupin?
const harry = 2
const ron = 4
const ginny = harry + 2 === ron // what is the value of ginny?
const dumbledore = ginny + 'hello' // what is the value of dumbledore?
const theSame = harry !== 'harry' // what is the value of theSame?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const lupin = 5 === 5 // true
const harry = 2
const ron = 4
const ginny = harry + 2 === ron // true
const dumbledore = ginny + 'hello' // "truehello"
const theSame = harry !== 'harry' // true, because 2 does not equal "harry"

/* 
If the dumbledore = ginny + 'hello' answer is confusing for you,
review the previous exercise answer for "5helloworld"
*/
```

</Spoiler>

# Truthy / Falsey

Now that you have learned a few data types, you should know that every data in
JavaScript is either truthy or falsey.

> **Every data is either truthy or falsey.**

**Falsey:** There are only **six falsey values** in JavaScript. (For now, just
remember the first 3. The others you will naturally get used to with
experience):

`false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `undefined`, `null`, `NaN` (Not a Number)

**Truthy: EVERYTHING ELSE** is truthy!

To illustrate, let's go over each data type we've learned:

| Data type | Falsey                | Truthy                                               |
| --------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Number    | 0, NaN (Not a Number) | Everything else, like -50, 100, 1999999, 0.1, etc.   |
| String    | "" (empty string)     | Everything else, like "hellofalse", "1234", "hello5" |
| Boolean   | false                 | true                                                 |

[Truthy / Falsey Examples](https://www.notion.so/4b3998c2aecb43418ea4b7d5501fe2ef)

## What's the Point?

Truthy and falsey properties are required for the following operators: `!`,
`||`, and `&&`.

## Not Operator: !

This operator looks at the value's truthy/falsey property and then returns the
opposite boolean.

```jsx
const josh = !0 // Since 0 is falsey, the opposite boolean is true
// Therefore, josh takes the value of true

const hannah = 0 // Keep in mind that 0 is a falsey value
const sirius = !hannah // sirius is a boolean, with value true
const charity = !'' // what is the value of charity?
const funny = !!'' // What is the value of funny?
const bone = !!!'hello world' // what is the value of bone?
const tricks = 'hello' + !!0 // what is the value of tricks?
const zach = false
const final = zach === tricks // what is the value of final?
const semi = zach === !tricks // what is the value of semi?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const josh = !0 // true
const hannah = 0
const sirius = !hannah // true
const charity = !'' // true
const funny = !!'' //false
const bone = !!!'hello world' // false
const tricks = 'hello' + !!0 // "hellofalse"
const zach = false
const final = zach === tricks // false
const semi = zach === !tricks // true
```

</Spoiler>

## And Operator: &&

The 'and' logical operator `&&` evaluates the left and right side's truthy and
falsey values in the following order:

1. If the left side is falsey, return that value.

   ```jsx
   const c = '' && 'hello' // c will be "" because the left side is falsey
   ```

2. If the left side is truthy, return the value on the right side.

   ```jsx
   let c = 'hello' && false // c is false
   c = 'hello' && 5 // What is the value of c?
   c = 5 && 'hello' // what is the value of c?
   c = true && '' // what is the value of c?
   c = 0 && 'hello' // what is the value of c?
   ```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let c = 'hello' && false // c is false
c = 'hello' && 5 // 5
c = 5 && 'hello' // hello
c = true && '' //
c = 0 && 'hello' // 0

// fyi, when printing an empty string in the terminal/console,
// it prints a blank line. You won't be able to see the actual empty string
```

</Spoiler>

## Or Operator: ||

(In case you cannot find the `|` symbol, it usually shares the same key as `\`
and is located above the return key.)

The 'or' operator `||` evaluates the left and right side's truthy and falsey
values in the following order:

1. If the left side is truthy, return that value.

   ```jsx
   const c = 'happy' || 'day' // c will be "happy" because the left side is truthy
   ```

2. If the left side is falsey, return the value on the right side.

   ```jsx
   const c = '' || 'hello' // c will be "hello"
   ```

## Exercises

```jsx
let a = 7 || false // what is the value of a?
a = false || 'hello' // what is the value of a?
a = 0 || 'world' // what is the value of a?
a = 7 || 9 // what is the value of a?

a = 7 && 9 // what is the value of a?
a = 0 && '' // what is the value of a?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let a = 7 || false // 7
a = false || 'hello' // "hello"
a = 0 || 'world' // "world"
a = 7 || 9 // 7  (first truthy value)

a = 7 && 9 // 9  (last truthy value)
a = 0 && '' // 0
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
let cedric = 5 && 'hello' // what is the value of cedric?
cedric = 5 && !'hello' // what is the value of cedric?
const albus = 5 + 5 || 0 // what is the value of albus?
const dumbledore = 0 || 10 // what is the value of dumbledore?
const harry = albus > 5 && albus < 10 // what is the value of harry?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let cedric = 5 && 'hello' // "hello"
cedric = 5 && !'hello' // false
const albus = 5 + 5 || 0 // 10
const dumbledore = 0 || 10 // 10
const harry = albus > 5 && albus < 10 // false
```

</Spoiler>

> `&&` and `||` is **not** associated with boolean `true / false`. It is more
> about choosing the left value or the right value.

## Conditional Statement: The if statement

Sometimes we might want our code to change its behavior based on certain
conditions. This happens all the time in life!

> **If** you work hard at coding, you will become a software engineer.

To tell the computer to do this, we use an `if` statement, which looks like the
following:

`if (*condition*) {`

`// block of code to be executed if the condition is true`

`}`

Since everything in JavaScript is either truthy or falsey, you can put anything
inside the parentheses.

The code inside the curly brackets will execute if the value inside the
parentheses is truthy. Below are a few examples:

```jsx
let a = 100 // a takes the value of 100
if (a % 2) {
  // a % 2 is 0, which is falsey,
  a = 90 // so everything inside { } will not be executed
}
const b = a + 1 // b takes the value of 101
```

```jsx
let a = 9 || 4 // 9 is truthy, so a takes the value 9 which is truthy
if (a > 5) {
  // 9 > 5 is truthy
  a = 90
}
const b = a + 1 // b takes the value of 91
```

## The else statement

Use the **else** statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the
condition is false.

```jsx
Syntax:

if ( *condition* ) {
// block of codes to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
// block of codes to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

```jsx
const total = 6
let result = ""          // declare and initialize result to empty string
if ( total < 5) {
  result = "Fail"
} else {
  result = "Pass"
*}*
```

As with coding in general, if you don't need it, don't use it!

Many engineers make the mistake of using `else` whenever they use `if`. Only use
`else` if you need to use it. You will slowly build an intuition over time, just
pay attention to your code review feedback from people reviewing your code.

# Objects

> This section (Objects) is moved here from JS3 on 4/29/2020. If this section is
> too complicated, please ask for help in the chatroom

Objects in JavaScript can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of
objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects like
cars, house, and people.

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
Compare it with a car, for example. A car is an object, with properties. A car
has color, design, weight, material it is made of, etc. In the same way, a
JavaScript object is a collection of properties where each property has a name
(also known as key) and a value, similar to a dictionary. The name of a property
can be any string, including an empty string. The value can be any value type,
such as a string, Boolean, number, and null, but it cannot be undefined.

So far, we have worked on the 3 types of primitive data types: number, string,
and boolean. These are called primitive data types because their values contain
only one single thing like a string, number, Boolean, or null. In contrast,
objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities, and as
such, the object data type is classified as a complex data type.

The last data type you will need to know is **Objects** and in this section we
will start with the most important object: the `Function` Object. Other objects
will be covered in JS2-3.

To create an object, you use the `new` keyword. Here's an example:

```jsx
// create a Person Object
const a = new Person()

// create an Array Object
const b = new Array()
```

Some of the Objects in the above example and the exercises below may not exist
in real life so if you try them out in the browser you may get an error.

**Exercises**

1. Create a Date object
2. Create a Function object
3. Create an Array object
4. Create an Object object
5. Create a EventEmitter object

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let a = new Date()
a = new Function()
a = new Array()
a = new Object()
a = new EventEmitter()
```

</Spoiler>

# Function

Have you ever had to do the same thing (like making rice) over and over again
and thought to yourself, _What if I wrote down instructions and had someone else
do this?_

> Example: Instructions to make rice:

1. Get a cup, fill it with rice
2. Pour cup of rice into rice cooker
3. Add 1 cup of water into rice cooker
4. Make sure rice cooker is plugged in, and press the _cook_ button

In the computer world, the above would be called a function.

A **function** is a set of instructions written to perform a specfic task.

A function is only executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Why use functions?

You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce
different results.

Example function (This is a very bad way to write functions and is designed to
only teach a concept. Do not write functions like this)

```jsx
const greet = new Function('a', 'b', "return a + ' says, hello ' + b")
/*
In the above example, greet is a variable that is a function object.
*/

// Function objects can be run by putting () behind a function.
let c = greet('Ironman', 'Poodle') // c is "Ironman says, hello Poodle"
c = greet('base9', 'base2') // c is "base9 says, hello base2"
```

Let's break down the above example.

- **Parameters**: Variables to hold the data when function run.
- **Run**: Running a function means to execute it by adding a `()` to the end.
- **Arguments**: Data you pass into the function when you run a function. Goes
  inbetween `()`
- **Function body**: Code that runs when a function is run. Notice how the
  function body is a string. After the Function Object is created, the string is
  converted into JavaScript code. In the example above, the code looks like the
  following:

  ```jsx
  return a + ' says, hello ' + b
  ```

- **Return**: The result of running the function. If the key word `return` is
  not in your function body, the function will automatically return `undefined`

## Exercises

```jsx
const fn = new Function('a', 'b', 'a + b')
const result = fn(23, 2) // what is result?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('a', 'b', 'a + b')
const result = fn(23, 2) // result is undefined
// since nothing is returned
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('return 10')
const result = fn() // what is result
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('return 10')
const result = fn() // result has 10 since return 10 is executed
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x === y')
let result = fn() // what is result?
result = fn(9, 9) // what is result?
result = fn(9, 8) // what is result?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x === y')
let result = fn() // what is result? result is true
// since both variables x and y have undefined values
result = fn(9, 9) // what is result? result is true
result = fn(9, 8) // what is result? result is false
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const secret = new Function('a', 'b', 'a = a + 9; return a + b')

let b = secret // what is b?
let c = secret('base9', 'base2') // what is c?
c = b(10, 2) // what is c?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const secret = new Function('a', 'b', 'a = a + 9; return a + b')

let b = secret // b is a function object
let c = secret('base9', 'base2') // c is base99base2
c = b(10, 2) // c is 21
```

</Spoiler>

Function body written using strings is a very unpleasant way to write functions.
There is an easier way.

```jsx
let greet = new Function('a', 'b', "return a + ' says, hello ' + b")
let secret = new Function('a', 'b', 'a = a + 9; return a + b')

// Another way of creating the function object above without using strings
greet = function (a, b) {
  return a + ' says, hello ' + b
}
secret = function (a, b) {
  a = a + 9
  return a + b
}
```

## Function Return

When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing,
return the returned value, and exit the function.

If the function was called from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to the
calling statement and continue to execute the next statement. Any return value
will be passed to the calling statement.

```jsx
// Calculate the sum of two numbers, and return the result:
const sum = function (a, b) {
  return a + b // Function returns the sum of a and b
  const c = a - b // this statement will NEVER be executed
}

const x = sum(4, 3) // Function sum is called,
// returned value will be assigned to variable x.
```

## Arrow Function

Another way to create a function object is to use an **arrow function** and its
definition includes the arrow symbol `=>`. Notice the keyword `function` is
missing. This is the preferred method today to create function objects. There
are differences between `function` and `() => {}` and that difference will be
covered in JS4.

```jsx
**Syntax:**

const name = (parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) => {
  // statements
}
```

To write an arrow function and store it into a variable called `makeBasket`,
code this:

```jsx
const makeBasket = () => {
  const b = 500
  return b
}
```

You can add instructions by putting them inside `{}`. In the above example, the
function creates a variable and then **returns** its value. `return` is a
keyword to **stop the function and give a result**.

```jsx
const snitch = makeBasket // what is snitch?
const batter = makeBasket // what is batter?
```

`=` means the left side stores the right side. Since the right side is a
function, both `snitch` and `batter` are functions. Note that they don't get the
value 500, because we haven't _run_ the function yet. We'll get to that soon.

This function is more complex than the functions we have done in the examples
above:

```jsx
const fn = (a, b) => {
  let c = a + b
  if (c > 2) {
    c = 0
  }
  return c + 1
}
const result = fn(22, 1)
```

The above function is the preferred method today to create function objects.

### Exercises

Write a function named `solution` that returns a value:

1. A number (try to be creative; use some number operators like `+ - * / %`).

<Spoiler offset='1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return 5 + 2
}
```

</Spoiler>

2. A string

<Spoiler offset='1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return 'Hello' + !'Hello'
}
```

</Spoiler>

3. A boolean

<Spoiler offset='1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return !'Hello'
}
```

</Spoiler>

4. A function

<Spoiler offset= '1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return () => {}
}
```

</Spoiler>

## Running a Function

You can tell the computer to carry out the instructions in a function by simply
adding `()` to the name of the function. For example, `makeBasket()` runs the
`makeBasket` function in the example above.

Running a function has many synonyms. You might hear "running a function,"
"executing a function," or "calling a function."

```jsx
const makeBasket = () => {
  return 500
}
const snitch = makeBasket // snitch is a function
const batter = makeBasket // batter is a function
const result1 = makeBasket() // result1 is 500
const result2 = snitch() // result2 is 500
const result3 = batter() // result3 is 500

/* 
IMPORTANT

result1 stores the returned value of running the makeBasket function
result2 stores the returned value of running the snitch function
result3 stores the returned value of running the batter function
*/
```

**Important**: By storing the returned value of running the function, we can now
use the `result1`, `result2`, and `result3` variables at a later time.

### Exercises

Note that not all these functions exist, so you don’t need to try running them
on your computer. Just write the statements to run the functions.

1. Run a function called `alert`

<Spoiler>

`alert()`

</Spoiler>

2. Run a function called `app.get`

<Spoiler>

`app.get()`

You can makeup any functions you want. Assume someone made up `app.get`
function, all you have to do is put `()` behind the function to run it.

</Spoiler>

3. Run a function called `console.log`

<Spoiler>

`console.log()`

  </Spoiler>

4. Run a function called `Object.keys`

<Spoiler>

`Object.keys()`

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const keeper = () => {
  return 5
}
let snitch = keeper // what is snitch?
snitch = !keeper // what is snitch?
snitch = !keeper() // what is snitch?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const keeper = () => {
  return 5
}
let snitch = keeper // function
snitch = !keeper // false: functions are truthy, so !truthy is false
snitch = !keeper() // false: now we run the function and get 5; !5 is false
```

</Spoiler>

## Examples

Functions are the most important concept in JavaScript (more on that
[later](https://www.notion.so/JS-3-Objects-3df846eaf0404fe6b012208773063a04#576cf18570c145c088f7ff3bc9435ef3)),
so here are more examples.

**Note:** You must step through each line like a computer. Keep in mind that
values of variables change constantly.

```jsx
let points = 0
const igor = () => {
  points = points + 1
  return points
}
let luna = igor // what is luna?

luna = igor() + igor() // what is luna?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let points = 0
const igor = () => {
  points = points + 1
  return points
}
let luna = igor // luna is a function

luna = igor() + igor() // 3, because 1 + 2

/*
Be careful: Every time igor is executed, the value of points get updated.
*/
```

</Spoiler>

If a function does not return anything, `undefined` is returned. `undefined` is
a JavaScript primitive data type. Note that `undefined` is falsey.

```jsx
const carrotCakeRecipe = () => {}
let snitch = carrotCakeRecipe() // snitch is undefined
snitch = !carrotCakeRecipe() // what is snitch?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const carrotCakeRecipe = () => {}
let snitch = carrotCakeRecipe() // undefined, because carrotCakeRecipe returns nothing
snitch = !carrotCakeRecipe() // true, because undefined is falsey
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const work = () => {
  const blah = 5 + 8
}
const wage = work() // what is wage?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const work = () => {
  const blah = 5 + 8
}
const wage = work() // wage is undefined
```

</Spoiler>

You can call functions within other functions:

```jsx
let people = ''
const igor = () => {
  people = people + ' muggle '
  return people
}

const solution = () => {
  igor()
  igor()
  igor()
}

const luna = solution() // what is luna?
// what is people?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let people = ''
const igor = () => {
  people = people + ' muggle '
  return people
}

const solution = () => {
  igor() // after this function runs, people has the value: " muggle "
  igor() // after this function runs, people has the value: " muggle  muggle "
  igor() // after this function runs, people has the value: " muggle  muggle  muggle "
}

const luna = solution() // luna is undefined
// people is " muggle  muggle  muggle "
```

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name='Thought process'>

Step by step of how an engineer would think through the problem above:

1. people takes the value `''`
2. igor is a function
3. solution is a function
4. luna is.... what ever solution returns. Lets run solution
5. Gotta run `igor`. people is `' muggle'`
6. Gotta run `igor`. people is `' muggle muggle'`
7. Gotta run `igor`. people is `' muggle muggle muggle'`
8. `solution` doesn't have the word `return`. So it returns undefined
9. `luna` is undefined.

An arrow function can return anything! In the previous examples, you have seen
functions returning a string, a number, or undefined.

Can you
`Write an arrow function named solution that returns another arrow function`?

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return () => {}
}
```

</Spoiler>

Here is another fun example:

```jsx
let people = ''
const igor = () => {
  return () => {
    people = people + ' muggle '
    return people
  }
}
const luna = igor() // luna is a function
let lovegood = luna() // lovegood has a value of " muggle "
lovegood = luna() // lovegood has a value of " muggle  muggle "
// because people was changed to " muggle " from
// running the previous function.
```

## Exercises

1. Write an arrow function named `solution` that runs a function called
   `console.log` three times and return a number.

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  console.log()
  console.log()
  console.log()

    console.log()
    console.log()
  }
}

## Parameters / Arguments

Sometimes, instructions might need requirements. When you write out instructions
for cooking rice, you need to make sure you have both rice and a rice cooker.

In the computer world, some functions might need additional data to run. For
example, the function `add2` would need a number first so it can add 2 to the
original number.

<div style = {{display:'flex', justifyContent:"space-between"}}>

!['example1'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/example1.png)

<div style = {{marginLeft:"1em"}}>

**Parameters** are inputs into a function. When writing a function, all
parameters are simply made-up variable names that will take the value of the
respective data when the function is called.

When you run a function, the data you pass in are called **arguments**.

 </div>

```jsx
const lucius = dobby => {
  return dobby + 2
}
let james = lucius(5) // james is 7, because lucius returns 5 + 2
james = lucius(5) === lucius(3) + 2 // what is the value of james?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const lucius = dobby => {
  return dobby + 2
}
let james = lucius(5) // james has value of 7, because lucius returns 5 + 2
james = lucius(5) === lucius(3) + 2 // james has true value, because 7 === 5 + 2

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {

const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3) + draco(3, 2, 1) // what is the value of malfoy?
// what is the value of points?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
// draco is a function that takes in 3 parameters: x, y, and z

const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3) + draco(3, 2, 1)

// draco(1,2,3) -> points now has 3 (was 0 before); draco returns 3 + 3
// draco(3,2,1) -> points now has 5 (was 3 before); draco returns 5 + 1
// (points is no longer 3)
// malfoy is 6 + 6, which is 12
// points is now 5

You can pass in anything to a function! Below is an example of passing a
function as an argument into another function:

```jsx
const grindle = () => {
  return 10
}
let wald = cast => {
  return cast()
}
let grindlewald = wald(grindle)
// Explanation for the above:
// We are passing the function **grindle** as an argument into the function **wald**
// **grindle function** is the input parameter **cast** for **wald function**
// **wald** returns the result of running the **cast function**, which is 10
// Therefore, grindlewald has the value of 10

wald = cast => {
  cast()
}
grindlewald = wald(() => {
  return 10
})
// In the above example, we are passing a function as an argument into
// the function wald (like the previous example).
// However, wald is a function that does not return anything,
// so it will return undefined by default.
// Therefore, grindlewald is undefined.
```

In this example, we will call the JavaScript setTimeout method. The setTimeout
method calls a function or executes some codes once after a specified delay (in
milliseconds).

The syntax is : **setTimeout**(_function_, _milliseconds_ ).

Note: use setTimeout() to repeat the execution continuously.

```jsx
const invisible = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    return 100
  }, 1000)
}
const cloak = invisible() // what is cloak?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const invisible = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    return 100
  }, 1000)
}
const cloak = invisible() // cloak is undefined
// invisible function first runs the setTimeout function with
//  2 arguments: function and 1000
// invisible function returns undefined
```

### Exercises

**HINT:** When you write a function, it does not matter what data types the
parameters are. Many of the following `write a function` questions should have
the same answer!

Write a function named `solution` that has:

1. a string parameter, and returns a function

2. a number parameter, and returns a function
3. a boolean parameter, and returns a function
4. a function parameter, and returns a function

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = one => {
  return () => {}
}
```

</Spoiler>

5. 2 parameters (a function and a number), and returns a function

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = (one, two) => {
  return () => {}
}
```

## Functions with Conditional Behavior

Remember that to execute code conditionally, you use an `if` statement, which
looks like the following:

`if (<condition>) {<instructions to run>}`

A truthy or falsey value goes inside the parentheses.

The code inside the curly brackets will execute if the value inside the
parentheses is truthy. Below are a few examples with functions:

```jsx
const remember = events => {
  if (events > 5) {
    return 'well done'
  }
  return 'fail'
}

let result = remember(0) // result will be "fail"
result = remember(20) // result will be "well done"
```

```jsx
const newt = x => {
  if (x === 5) {
    return 13
  }
  return x + 1
}
let tonks = newt(3) // what is the value of tonks?
tonks = newt(11) // what is the value of tonks?
tonks = newt(5) // what is the value of tonks?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const newt = x => {
  if (x === 5) {
    return 13
  }
  return x + 1
}
let tonks = newt(3) // 4
tonks = newt(11) // 12
tonks = newt(5) // 13
```

# Execution Context

Let's explore what happens when the following function is run, step by step.

Before the computer runs your code, it first creates a box to store all the
variables. We call this box the **global** **execution context**.

Every time the computer runs a function, it will create a new box inside the box
where the function was created (after you understand this, replace the word
**box** with **execution context**). Let's use the following example:

Before the computer runs the code, it first creates a global execution context.

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3)
const mal2 = draco(3, 2, 1)
```

!['exec1'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution11.png)

</div>

**Line 1 - create a global variable named points. Line 2 - create a global
variable named draco.**

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
...
...
```

!['exec2'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution12.png)

</div>

**Line 6 - Run the draco function with 1,2,3.**

Remember, every time a function is run, a box (**local or functional execution
context**) is created. Since there are 3 parameters, this local execution
context has 3 local variables.

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
const malfoy = draco(1,2,3) // line 6
...
```

!['exec3'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution13.png)

</div>

**Line 3: Inside the draco function, the gobal variable `points` in the global
execution context is updated to 3.**

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky  // line 3
  ...
}
const malfoy = draco(1,2,3)
...
```

!['exec4'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution14.png)

</div>

**Line 4: draco function returns 6** - Function is done, line 6 continues, and
malfoy takes the value of 6. The local execution context for draco function is
removed and is no longer accessible.

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy  // line 4
}
const malfoy = draco(1,2,3)  // line 6
...
```

!['exec5'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution15.png)

</div>

**Line 7: Run draco function with 3,2,1**

Remember, every time a function is run, a new **local execution context** is
created. Since there are 3 parameters, this new local execution context has 3
local variables:

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3)
const mal2 = draco(3, 2, 1) // line 7
```

!['exec6'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution16.png)

</div>

**Line 3: Inside the draco function. The global `points` variable is updated
to 5.**

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky  // line 3
  ...
}
const malfoy = draco(1,2,3)
const mal2 = draco(3,2,1)
```

!['exec7'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution17.png)

</div>

**Line 4: draco function returns 6** - Function is done, line 7 continues, and
mal2 takes the value of 6

<div className="MDX_twoColumns">

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy // line 4
}
const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3)
const mal2 = draco(3, 2, 1) // line 7
```

!['exec8'](/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution18.png)

</div>

Done! Before the execution of the codes ends, the global execution context has
the following global variables:

```jsx
points: 5
draco: function
malfoy: 6
mal2: 6
```
