# Important Commands

In this section we will be going over the following commonly used commands:

> `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`

Type `pwd` **(print working directory)** into your terminal. If your username is
`cookie`, you might see:

- `/Users/cookie` (on a Mac)
- `/home/cookie` (on Ubuntu)
- `C:\Users\cookie\Documents` (on Windows).
  - If you are on Windows, type `cd ..` to go up a folder; then if you type
    `pwd` again, you should see `C:\Users\cookie\`.

This is the folder in which all your files and folders are saved, called the
**home folder**.

Type `ls` **(list)**, \***\*or `dir` **(directory)\*\* for Windows, into your
terminal. This command shows you a list of all the files and folders in the
current folder (which should be your home folder). `Desktop` should be one of
the folders; let's go in there!

`cd` **(change directory)** is the command that lets you go into a folder.
However, you need to tell the computer which folder to go into. You need to type
`cd Desktop` and press `Enter` to go into the Desktop folder.

> **Pro tip**: You can type cd Desk and then hit `tab` to auto-complete.
> Software engineers use tab to type less, which reduces the chance of typos. If
> you have multiple files and folders that start with the same name, hitting
> `tab` may fail because the computer does not know how to autocomplete your
> request. You will have to type a few more characters and then hit `tab`.

`mkdir notes2357` creates a new folder called notes2357 in the current folder
(which should be Desktop), and you should be able to see the folder if look at
your desktop in the GUI.

To see all the files and folder in your desktop folder, type `ls` (`dir` for
Windows).

## Path

The **path** to a folder is the list of all the other folders you have to go
through to get to it. The longer the path is, the "deeper" that folder is nested
inside other folders. To see the full path of where you currently are, you can
type `pwd` (`cd` for Windows).

When using paths, `~` is a short way to write out the path to your home folder:

- For example, if your home folder is `/home/cookie`,
  `mkdir ~/Desktop/notes2357/curriculum` will create a folder called
  `curriculum` inside the `notes2357` folder.

`..` means the **parent folder**:

Let's assume our current path is: `/home/cookie/Desktop/notes2357/curriculum`

- `ls ..` will list out the files and folders in
  `/home/cookie/Desktop/notes2357`
- `ls ../../..` will list out the files and folders in `/home/cookie`
- `cd ../..` will take you to `/home/cookie/Desktop/`

> Make sure you include a space between the command (`ls`) and the options (like
> `..`, `../..`, etc.).
