## Code Editor

You can choose any editor you want VS Code, WebStorm IDE, Sublime Text or even
Vim.

We recommend using VS Code. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/) VS Code.

## Creating a File

1. Launch VS Code. Type **code** in command line interface prompt or search bar
   (the most common CLI [commands](/docs/cli)).

> **Pro tip**: In the terminal, you can simply type `code .` to launch VS Code
> in the current folder. To set up this terminal shortcut in macOS, open up VS
> Code, and use `cmd + shift + p` to open Search. Type in `shell`, and install
> the 'code' command.

2. Use your code editor to write some JavaScript code. Type the following:

   ```jsx
   a = 'hello'
   console.log(a)
   ```

3. Save your file as `test.js` in any folder you decide.

## Running JavaScript Codes On Computer

Now that you have your code, you need to run it with a program called
**`node.js`**.

1. Download the latest stable version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), **a
   program to run JavaScript**. If you're using Windows install
   [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
   first and follow instructions for Linux from now on.

   1. For companies that use `node`, the best practice is to use
      [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install node.js.
   1. [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
   1. use `nvm` to install node version 14 by typing into your terminal:
      `nvm i 14`.

   [Installing NodeJS on ChromeBook](/docs/chromebook).

1. Open your terminal and use `cd` to go to the folder that contains your file.
1. Run your file using node: `node test.js`.
1. You should see the output `hello`.

## Browser-based setup

If you don't want to install node locally you use run javascript code in your
browser. Go to
[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum). You'll
be asked to create an account or you can also login using a Github account.

## Running HTML Codes on the Browser

Sometimes, you want to test something really quick and you are simply too lazy
to create a new file. You can also write some quick code on the browser and
immediately run it.

1. Open your browser, then right-click on the browser, then click on
   `Inspect Element` or `Inspect` (Firefox and Chrome).

<Image height={471} width={513} src={'/assets/docs/setup/inspect.png'} />

2. In the screen that appears, click on the `Console` tab:

<Image
  height={448}
  width={1444}
  src={'/assets/docs/setup/console.png'}
  proportions="long"
/>

3. After that, you can start typing code! For now, type `console.log("hello")`.
   And then type enter key.

4. To write code on multiple lines, you must type Shift + Enter (only Enter for
   Windows).

Alternatively, you can run node directly from terminal. Type `node` to start
node REPL (read–eval–print loop).

## Running HTML Codes from VS Code

Once you have completed writing and saving your HTML codes on a file name
xxxx.html, you are ready to run the html codes on a browser. The easiest way is
to run the codes directly from VS Code. However, before you can run the html
codes, you will need to install the **_open in browser_** extension by
**_techER._**

Launch VS Code.

For Mac users: Click on **Code** → **Preferences** → **Extensions**. Or use
[**shift**] + [**command**] + [**x**] keys.

For window users: Click on **File** → **Preferences** → **Extensions**. Or use
[**Ctrl**] + [**Shift**] + [**X**] keys.

Enter **open in browser** in search box, and then select **open in browser** by
**techER**. Install the extension.

While you are in VS Code, edit your html file. For window users, **right click**
and select **View in Browser.** For Mac users, press [**control**] key and
**click** and select **Open in Default Browser,** or press [**option**]+[**B**]
keys.

Your default browser will be launched with your html file running.

## Submitting Challenges

> You can skip this section and come back when you finish
> [JS 0 - Foundations](https://www.notion.so/JS-0-Foundations-a43ca620e54945b2b620bcda5f3cf672).

Create an account on [c0d3.com/signup](/signup) if you don't already have one.

For most of the steps below, you will be typing the commands into the
**terminal**.

These steps are the same set of instructions you will most likely follow at
work. Each challenge you solve is simulating building a feature at work.

If this is all new to you, these steps may seem very intimidating. When you
start a new job, you will be equally intimidated because of all the specific
tools each company uses. It is important to ask questions when you feel
overwhelmed, there will be people on the chatroom help answer your questions.

### Local Setup

When you join a software engineering company, the first step is setting up your
machine, downloading the codebase, and setting up the codebase.
([video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnRgR7z0rFU&t=254s))

1. After installing `node`, install c0d3 CLI (used to submit challenges):
   `npm i -g c0d3`.

   If you run into a `Missing write access ... EACCES` error, you need to run
   npm with sudo: `sudo npm i -g c0d3`.

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   and familiarize yourself with [common git commands](/docs/git).
1. Use git to [clone the curriculum](https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum)
   into your machine: `git clone https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum`.
1. Go into the curriculum root folder by typing `cd curriculum`.
1. Download the necessary libraries by running `yarn install`.

### Browser Setup

1. Go to
   [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum).
   You'll be asked to create an account or you can also login using a Github
   account.
2. After your workspace is created, you'll have most of the tools you need at
   your disposal (`git`, `node`, `npm` and `yarn`). You'll need to install only
   the c0d3 CLI tool used to submit the challenges, by typing `npm i -g c0d3` on
   the terminal at the bottom of the screen. **Note:** every time your workspace
   is restarted you'll need to run this command again.
3. After installing the CLI tool, type `c0d3 login` and enter your C0D3 account
   credentials to be able to submit the challenges.
4. Now the only thing remaining is to download the necessary libraries by
   running `yarn install`.

### Solving Challenges

`git status` is your best friend. It tells you what branch you are currently on
and which files are changed and/or staged for commit.

Solving each challenge is like building a feature at work. You must always
checkout `checkout master` before creating a new branch to work on a new
feature.

Branch names: Usually branch names are for your own eyes only, so you do not
have create branches with meaningful names.

_Note: Except for steps 3 (reading the challenge) and 4 (open and editing the
file), all the commands should be run in the terminal_

1. Make sure you are on the master branch: `git checkout master`.
2. Create a new branch from master (pro tip: `p1` for problem 1):
   `git checkout -b p1`.
3. Go to [c0d3.com](/), click on Curriculum, select lesson 0, and read
   challenge 1.
4. Write the solution by opening, editing, and saving `js0/1.js` (means file
   _1.js_ inside folder _js0_).
5. Test your file by running `npm run test`. (Make sure tests are passing 100%)
   You will have to type `q` or `CTRL c` to get out of the test script.
6. Add and commit changed files. **Do not commit `package-lock.json` file**.

   - `git add js0/1.js` → stages the file to be saved.
   - `git commit -m "solves problem 1"` → saves the changes.

     If you forget to put `-m`, you will be put into vim. To get out, type `:wq`
     to save and exit.

     The commit message (the text that comes after `-m`) should be present tense
     and describe what the change does.

     If you do `git status` and see changes to the file `package-lock.json` or
     `yarn-lock.json`, you would also commit these changes at work. These files
     lock in the version of the libraries used to run your files. However, to
     make reviews for your submission easier, **do not commit** changes to these
     files.

7. Submit your solution: `c0d3 submit`
   - Note: You will be prompted to choose the exact lesson and challenge you are
     currently submitting. You should select lesson 0 and problem 1.
   - Go back to your student page (c0d3.com → Curriculum → lesson 0), refresh
     it, and see the solution you just submitted!
8. Go back to **step 1** and repeat for the next challenge.

Make sure you go back to STEP 1 and run `git checkout master` so you are on
master branch before creating a new branch so you can start the next problem
fresh. If you don't then you will be creating a new branch from existing branch
and all your solutions will be piled up together.

**If you accidentally made a commit to your `master` branch, you need to undo
the commit.**

1. Undo the last commit: `git reset HEAD~`.
2. Go to the branch for your problem (we will use `p1` as an example):
   - If the branch does not exist, you need to create one: `git checkout -b p1`.
   - If the branch exists, you can just switch to it (by omitting the `-b`
     option): `git checkout p1`.
3. Continue with step 6 and onwards (add and commit).

### Getting Feedback

As a software engineer, after submitting a feature you will wait for other
software engineers to review your code.

Similarly, after submitting your solution, your solution will be reviewed by
other engineers to make sure you are following best practices in your code.

You should be able to see your submissions when you go to the
[Curriculum](/curriculum) and selecting a lesson.

It can take some time for a mentor to review your code. Feel free to go to
[JS0-Foundations chatroom](https://discord.gg/VcQchQVSat) to request a review.

If your code is not following best practices, your submission will get rejected.
The following steps will help you resubmit.

_Example_: Problem 5 is rejected.

1. Go to the branch that has the commit for problem 5: `git checkout p5` (if
   your branch was called p5).
2. Open and edit the file `js0/5.js` and address the comment you received.
3. Add and commit changed files:
   - `git add js0/5.js` → stages the file to be saved
   - `git commit -m "fixes problem 5 suggestion"` → saves the changes
4. Submit your solution again: `c0d3 submit`.

### Completing your submission

As a software engineer, you need to merge your code back into your `master`
branch after the code has been approved.

When **all of your submissions** have been approved, you need to follow these
steps ([video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzZqwUXIc00)):

1. Go to the master branch: `git checkout master`.
   - If you have done this correctly, you will notice that all of the your
     solutions are missing. This is because your solutions are on different
     branches and we need to merge them in.
2. Merge your branch containing the solution to problem 1 (we will use `p1` as
   example) into your existing (master) branch:
   - `git merge p1`.
   - By doing this, `master` branch will now have your solution to challenge 1.
3. Merge your branch containing problem 2 solution (we will be using `p2` as an
   example) into your existing (master) branch:
   - `git merge p2`.
   - By doing this, `master` branch will now have your solution to challenge 2.
4. Continue merging the remaining branches into `master`.
   - At this point, `master` should have all the approved solutions to all the
     challenges in this lesson.
