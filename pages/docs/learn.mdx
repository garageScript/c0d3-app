### Curriculum

The following lessons covers all the JavaScript foundations you would need to be
a full stack software engineer. To get started, go to [c0d3.com/signup](/signup)
to sign up for an account. Make sure your password is > 8 characters.

When you work as a software engineer, you can't study your way into success.
Most companies have bad documentation and use tools in a way that you have never
seen before. Therefore, communication and courageously asking for help is a
critical skill to becoming an impactful engineer.
