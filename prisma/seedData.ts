Your server sends the request to [the auth api](https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/session) to get information about your user. \n\nSample header\n```\nAuthorization: "Bearer a-jwt-token"\n```\n\nProvide the following APIs. Respond with a 403 status code if user is not not logged in.  \n\n* GET `/api/session` - sends back the user information. The front end uses this to determine whether to render the login page or enter room page.\n* POST `/api/:room/messages` - Creates a new message in the room.\n* GET `/api/:room/messages` - Gets the messages in the room.\n\nNote: You should be using a middleware to set the user into the request object. \n\nIn this example, you are using a 3rd party user signup / login service to store your user\'s login credentials. In the industry, some companies choose not to implement their own signup / login services and use a third party service.',

Make sure you have a `video` element to display the video, and set the video element's `srcObject` property to the video stream so users can see their video.\n3. When users click on the snap button, you need to draw the video into your canvas element to get an image of the video. To do this, first get the context (think of context as a paintbrush): `const context = canvas.getContext('2d')`. \n4. Then, draw the video by passing the video element into the drawImage function: `context.drawImage(video, 0, 0)`\n5. Next, you want to get the image data from context using `canvas.toDataURL()`\n5.

Send the data to your server.\n6. When your server receives the data, you can simply write the image data into your server. Since the image is encoded as base 64, make sure you specify it: `fs.writefile(filePath, imgData, 'base64', () => {})`\n2.

Keep it simple this time, no need to create an account or use a password, only the username.\n2. After getting in, user should see his video and input box. When user types something and hits enter, his image and text will be sent to server.\n3. When server receives image data, it needs to decode the base64 image data to Buffer so the image can be manipulated: `const imageData = Buffer.from(req.body.data, 'base64');`\n4. Next, use `Jimp` just like in challenge 3 to draw the text onto the image and write it to file as `username.png`. Jimp can load an image from a buffer the same way it loads from an url: `Jimp.read(imageData)`.\n5. When the user types into the input box and hits enter again, the meme will be saved as `username.png`. Every user should always only have 1 image.\n6. When another person joins the room, they should see memes of everybody in the chatroom that updates in realtime. \n7. When you get this far, you will notice that images do not change even though the files have changed. This is because of browser caching. To bust the cache, you can add a date query params to the end of the image request, for example: `username.png?${Date.now}`.\n8. If you bust the cache this way, you will see that images are now always flickering. Flickering is happening because it takes the browser awhile to retrieve the image. To get around this problem, you should render all the images into an invisible div. When all the images are loaded, then show the invisible div and hide the current div. This way, users will see a smooth instantaneous update of the images.",

Refactor the previous lesson (stars) by removing all the libraries you included in your HTML file and use webpack to build a file that contains all the JavaScript you need to run. All the functionalities should stay the same.\n\nIn production, you don't want the browser to be always be using Babel to render your React code into JavaScript that browser understands. Instead, you want to compile it first, then add the output JavaScript to your HTML. `Webpack` helps you with the compilation. Your goal in this challenge is to setup webpack to build your previous challenge (and future challenges) into JavaScript that your browser can understand. With Webpack, you can now use any npm modules in your application!\n\n1. First, you want to create a webpack config. The file must be named `webpack.config.js`. \n2. To compile your code, run `webpack --watch`. We include the watch option so that whenever our file changes, webpack compiles the file automatically.\n3.

To send data from server to client, `socket.emit('eventName', data)` sends to one user, `io.emit('eventName', data)`  sends to every user connected, and `socket.broadcast.emit('eventName', data)` sends to every user except the socket user.\n\n6. Client sends data to the server the same way, by using `socket.emit`. \n\n7. To listen to events, simply bind an event listener to the socket: `socket.on('eventName', (data) => ....)`\n\n8.
