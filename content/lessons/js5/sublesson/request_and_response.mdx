# Intro

In this section, you will be writing code that runs on the computer using
`node`, an application that runs JavaScript code. Everything in this section is
about figuring out how to use the libraries that engineers have written for you
to build the application you want.

## Preflight

Before you start, make sure you understand these concepts.

1. (line by line) `node app.js` runs a file called `app.js`. When a file is run,
   the computer will go through the code, line by line starting at the top.

   ```jsx
   // app.js
   const fruits = []
   fruits.push('apple')
   console.log(fruits)
   ```

   Let's say you run the file a few times:

   ```jsx
   node app.js
   node app.js
   node app.js

   // What gets printed out?
   ```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
;['apple']['apple']['apple']
```

</Spoiler>

2. (async) Make sure you understand the async nature of JavaScript!

   ```jsx
   let counter = 1
   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log(counter)
     counter = counter + 1
   }, 1)
   console.log(counter)
   // what gets printed out?
   ```

<Spoiler>

```jsx

1
```

</Spoiler>

3. (Non-Primitive) Make sure you understand the nature of objects in JavaScript!

   ```jsx
   const data = {}
   setTimeout(() => {
     const newObj = data
     console.log(newObj.name)
     newObj.name = 'hello'
   }, 10)
   setTimeout(() => {
     const newObj = data
     console.log(newObj.name)
     newObj.name = 300
   }, 5)
   console.log(data.name)
   ```

## Overview

First you will use a few libraries to help you learn the underlying concepts
behind the internet. Once you understand these concepts, we will go over some
problems that companies face when trying to scale their technology to prepare
you for system design.

Previously, you learned that URL is made up of the `protocol`, `hostname`,
`path`, and `query parameters`.

We can pass data into a request by using the URL's **query parameters**.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js3/urlStructure.png"
  width="480"
  height="77"
/>

- **Protocol** - Specifies how the data is transferred and how to interpret the
  request. When you look at the protocol, you should have a high level idea of
  what the url is used for.
  - **http** - Runs on port 80 by default, specifies what headers are in the
    request and what the header means. The headers we cover in this lesson deals
    specifically with the **http** protocol.
  - **https** - Same as _http_ protocol with two differences:
    - Runs on port 443 by default
    - Encrypts all of your request / response headers except request IP
- **Path & query parameters**: Sends data to the server in the request url. This
  is usually used in marketing teams to see how advertising is doing.
  - `&` separates the different pieces of data.
    - `https://macys.com/shoes?size=4&brand=allbirds&type=outdoors`
  - Sending data using path and query parameters has a few notable drawbacks:
    - **Security risk**: All data in the URL is exposed. Sensitive data like
      usernames and passwords must never be put in the query parameters. Imagine
      sending someone a postcard with your username and password on the
      postcard. Everyone can see it, it is not secure.
    - **Data limit**: The URL cannot hold large amounts of data. In fact, many
      browsers will not be able to handle URLs longer than 2048 characters. That
      is not a lot—only 2KB of data.
      - Imagine sending someone a postcard, there is only so much you can write
        before you run out of space

In this chapter you will learn other ways of sending data to the server.
Everything you learn will only be applicable to the **http** or **https**
protocol. The protocol is the first letters before `://` in a url.

Quick overview of other protocols (Feel free to read more about these, but you
are not expected to know these in your day to day role as a software engineer).

- SMTP, POP3, IMAP - Email protocols used for sending emails. Usually runs on
  port 25, 110, 143 respectively.
- SSH - Protocol for accessing remote machines as well as managing your `git`
  repositories. Usually runs on port 22.
- FTP - Protocol for sending files. Usually port 21.
- DNS - Protocol for getting an **IP Address** using a hostname. **IP Address**
  is the address of a computer in the internet. Usually port 53.

When it comes to port numbers, we say **usually** because you can very easily
specify the application to run on ports other than the default ones. When you
create your server, you will be sending http requests to your own specified port
instead of the default port 80.

## IP Addresses

The internet as you know it is powered by computers talking to each other. Every
machine in the network will have an `IP Address`. This is very similar address
as you know it.

- MD graph code

  Code used to generate the graphs above using
  [mermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/#/edit/eyJjb2RlIjoiZ3JhcGggTFJcblx0QVtCcm93c2VyXSAtLT58MS4gU2VuZHMgUmVxdWVzdHwgQihTZXJ2ZXIpIC0tPiB8Mi4gU2VuZHMgUmVzcG9uc2V8IEFcdFx0XHRcdCIsIm1lcm1haWQiOnsidGhlbWUiOiJkZWZhdWx0In0sInVwZGF0ZUVkaXRvciI6ZmFsc2V9)

  ```jsx
  graph LR
  	A[Browser] -->|1. Sends Request| B(Server) --> |2. Sends Response| A
  ```

1. When you type a **url** into the browser, or when you click on a link, the
   browser is sending a **request** to a **server**, which is essentially
   someone's computer.
2. When the server (aka someone's computer) receives a request, it sends back a
   **response**. This response is usually HTML, but it can sometimes be just
   data (like the examples you did in JS3).
3. When the browser receives the response from the server, the browser will
   decide what to do with the response. If the response is HTML, then the
   browser will start executing the instructions in the HTML.

If you send a request using the terminal and run your JavaScript with `node`,
the process is exactly the same

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/terminalServer.png"
  height="76"
  width="339"
/>

If the response is HTML, the terminal would not do anything automatically with
the response data since HTML is instructions for the browser only.

## Request

Every request that gets sent over the internet is made up of
[2-3 parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_message)

1. **Request line** - Consist of **request method** and **path**
   - Request method tells the server what type of request this is.
   - **path** is extracted from the URL you provide.
2. **Headers** - Headers to provide information about the request. The
   information includes: the type of browser / terminal that the request is sent
   from, what type of data is contained in the request body, information for
   identifying the user, etc. There is a
   [full list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields),
   but we will cover only the most important ones in the next section.
3. **Body** - (Optional) Blob of data in the request. The request headers
   determine how this blob of data should be handled. Examples of data the body
   could contain are: strings, JSON string, and files like images, videos,
   documents, etc.

When you visit a webpage, you can view information about a request in the
_network tab_ from the _developer console_ on your browser.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/networkTab.png"
  height="546"
  width="957"
/>

### Request Methods

Request methods describes what type of request it is and shows up in the first
line of the request. The request below is a `GET` request that the browser sends
out when I type in a url into the browser and hit enter.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/requestMethods.png"
  height="560"
  width="786"
/>

Here's a list of the most commonly used request methods that you need to know.
The specification for these request methods are simply best practices to follow.
You can choose to ignore these practices but keep in mind that doing so will
confuse and annoy other software engineers who takes over your code.

- `GET` - A GET request is used for getting data. It should not have body in the
  request. This is the browser's default request to send when you visit a
  website. When you write code and you don't specify a method, it defaults to
  `GET` request.
- `HEAD` - a HEAD request is used for getting response headers. It should not
  have a body in the request. The server will also not send a body in the
  response. The server will only send back response headers.
- `POST` - A POST request is used to tell the server to create data like user
  account, new image, etc. It will have a body in the request containing the
  data that needs to be created in the server.
- `DELETE` - A DELETE request is used to tell the server to delete data. It
  should not have a body in the request.
- `PATCH` - A PATCH request is used to to tell the server to edit a particular
  attribute in the data. For example, change the name for a user, edit the due
  date for a task, etc. It should have a body in the request.
- `PUT` - A PUT request is used to tell the server to replace existing or create
  new data. It should have a body in the request. What makes this request
  different from a `PATCH` request is that this request will contain all the
  attributes needed to create a new record.
- `OPTIONS` - An OPTIONS request is sent by the browser for security reasons;
  you will never need to send an OPTIONS request yourself. The browser will send
  an OPTIONS request before sending out some **cross-domain** requests (requests
  to a url with a different hostname than the one you are currently on).

  OPTIONS requests are called **pre-flight** requests.

  Example:

  1. You are currently on `[c0d3.com](http://c0d3.com)`.
  2. The JavaScript instructs the browser to send a PUT request to -
     `[api.slacker.club/api/lessons](http://api.slacker.club)`.
  3. The browser notices that the hostname is different so it sends an OPTIONS
     request to
     `[api.slacker.club/api/lessons](http://api.slacker.club/api/lessons)`. The
     server sends back a response saying whether it is okay to send a PUT
     request to `api.slacker.club/api/lessons`

     **Cross-Domain requests**: requests that are sent to a url with a different
     hostname than the url you are currently on.

  4. If browser is allowed to send a request, the browser now sends the PUT
     request.

> Of all the request methods covered above, GET, DELETE, and OPTIONS request do
> not have body in the request. POST, PATCH, PUT request has a body in the
> request.

Here is a sample code to send a `DELETE` request. Notice we are passing an
object as the second argument. To send a different request method, simply change
the `method` property.

```jsx
fetch('https://songz.c0d3.com/api/todos', {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
```

### Request Headers

Every request has a header that describes the request. In this section we will
go over a few important request headers.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/requestHeaders.png"
  height="560"
  width="786"
/>

In the list below, there are only two headers you would set manually when
sending a request: Content-Type and Authorization. Although you can set the
other headers, they are usually handled by the browser automatically.

- `Content-Type` - When a request has a body (PUT, POST, PATCH requests), you
  must provide a `content-type` header to specify what kind of data is in the
  body. Most of the time it would be `application/json` in the request when
  writing code, but you could also be sending files to the server and use other
  types of `content-type`:
  - `application/json` - JSON data
  - `text/html` - HTML text
  - `image/gif` - A gif image
  - `video/mpeg` - MPEG videos
  - And
    [many more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Complete_list_of_MIME_types)!
    You don't have to memorize any of these
- `Authorization` - This is used by the server to identify who the user is.
  Unlike cookie, this header must be set manually by the developer when sending
  the request. Commonly used for API requests and JWT authentication (covered
  below).
- `Cookie` - This is used by the server to identify who the user is. Most of the
  time, the browser automatically sends the cookie with every request.
- `User-Agent` - Information about the browser and/or mobile device sending the
  request.
- `Origin` - Indicates from which hostname a fetch came from.
- `ETag` - string representing the data that the browser already has (aka hash)
  from a previous GET request. If the server notices that the data it is about
  to send back matches the `ETag` in the request, the server will not send back
  with the response body, resulting in saved bandwidth!
- `X-Forwarded-For` - This header will only be visible on your server and will
  be covered in the server section below. In short, when your server application
  is behind a proxy (99% of all applications) receives the request, this header
  gives you the ip address of the client (phone or computer or device that sent
  the request).
- [List of other headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)

A sample POST request. Notice how we have to specify the `content-type` header
of the request and make sure we pass in a string as the `body` value.

```jsx
fetch('https://songz.c0d3.com/api/todos', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    task: 'learn request headers',
    status: 'starting'
  })
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

A sample `PATCH` request

```jsx
fetch('https://songz.c0d3.com/api/todos/0e750eff-f872-4ac4-a1b0-ec7a877b1d6e', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    status: 'complete'
  })
})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/options.png"
  width="1047"
  height="216"
/>

If you are on a different domain and running these code on the browser console,
you should see the browser send an OPTIONS request automatically before each
PATCH request.

## Response

Responses are structurally very similar to requests. Every response that gets
sent over the internet is made up of
[2-3 parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Response_message)

1. **Status Code** - A number that quickly describes what happened. For example,
   the server sends back status code 200 when everything went well.
2. **Headers** - Headers to provide information about the response. The
   information includes: the type of server that sent the response, what type of
   data is contained in the response body, as well as commands for the browser.
   We will be covering the most important headers.
3. **Body** - (Optional) Blob of data in the response. The response headers
   determine how this blob of data should be handled. Examples of data the body
   could contain are: strings, JSON string, and files like images, videos,
   documents, etc.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/response.png"
  width="956"
  height="504"
/>

In the sections below, make sure you pay attention to how the response status
codes and headers affect the browser.

### Status Codes

The specification for response status codes are simply best practices to follow.
When writing code to accept incoming requests, you can choose to ignore these
practices but keep in mind that doing so will confuse and annoy those who send
requests to you.

The only status code that **affects the browser's behavior** are the ones in 300
range. The most common ones are:

- `302` - The server responds with 302 when it wants the request to go to
  another URL. When the browser (or `node-fetch` library in node) receives this
  response code, it will take the new url from the response's `Location` header
  and send another request to the new URL automatically
- `304` - (Review the `ETag` header section in the request headers first). The
  server sends back a 304 status code when it realizes that the response body
  matches the request `ETag` headers so instead of sending back the response
  body the server will send back a 304 status code with no body to save
  bandwidth. When the browser receives this code, it will automatically use its
  own data saved from the previous requests.

The other status codes are primarily informational. Code in 200s indicates that
everything went well, code in 400s indicates that there was a user error, and
code in 500s indicates that there was a server error.

- `200` - The server sends back 200 when everything went smoothly.
- `201` - The server sends back 201 when everything went smoothly and something
  had been created in the server. Usually a response code for POST requests.
- `400` - The server sends back 400 when the request is bad. Missing required
  data or incompatible data (ie. username too short, invalid characters, etc.)
- `403` - The server sends back 403 when the user is trying to access a page
  he/she does not have permission for. Normally, server uses the request's
  `cookie` or `authorization` header to determine who the user is in every
  request.
- `404` - The server sends back 404 when the url in the request is not supported
  by the browser.
- `418` - The server sends back 418 when the server is a teapot and it receives
  a request to brew coffee.
- `500` - The server sends back 500 when it has encountered an internal error
  and could not process the request.
- [A full list of status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) -
  All the important ones you will need to memorize is covered above.

### Headers

Response headers can be very generic (such as specifying the type of response
body data) and also very specific (some response headers are only necessary for
certain requests).

- `Cache-Control` - This header tells the browser to save the response body for
  a period of time. Within this time period, the browser should use the saved
  data immediately instead of sending the request. This not only saves bandwidth
  for the user, but also makes the website faster.

  Example that saves the response for 1 hour: `Cache-Control: max-age=3600`

- `ETag` - A hash string that represents the content of the response body. The
  browser will now send this `ETag` with every request with the same url (review
  request header above if necessary).
- `Server` - A name for the server that processed the request.
- `Set-Cookie` - This header tells the browser to set a cookie. After the
  browser sets the cookie, the browser will automatically send the cookie in the
  request header with every request to the same host name.
- `Content-Type` - This header tells the browser how to read the response body.

Some response headers have very specific use cases. The header below is used in
conjunction with 300 status codes.

- `Location` - This header contains a url, which tells the requestor (browser or
  node) the new URL to resend the request to.

When the browser needs to make cross domain request, it first sends an OPTIONS
request. The browser looks for very specific headers in the response to
determine if it should proceed to send the cross-domain request. Review the
OPTIONS request method above if you need to before proceeding. We will go over
the important ones.

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` - Contains the host name that is allowed to send
  the cross domain request. If this does not match the hostname of the site that
  the user is on, then the cross domain is rejected.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` - If this is true in the response header,
  then the cross domain request will include a cookie header. If this is false,
  the browser will not set the cookie header when sending the cross origin
  request.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` - This is a comma separated string that tells
  the browser what request methods are allowed in the cross domain request. The
  request will not be sent if the request method is not included in this
  response header.

## Exercise & Learn

In this exercise we will send different types of requests and observe the
response from the server. Before proceeding, make sure you know how to look at
the network request. We will be using it throughout the exercise.

As you complete this exercise, you will not only learn how to observe the
request and responses, you will also learn some industry standards.

We will be using an API to create login, create accounts, create, edit, and
delete todo items. All requests that you are sending from your file are called
**Cross-Origin** requests because your browser requests to a hostname that is
different from where your file is located.

Although everything is secure (as you will see when you implement the API
features yourself), feel free to use insecure passwords and fake emails. There
will be no verification needed.

1. [Save the code here](https://js5.c0d3.com/setup_todo.html) into a html file
   on your computer. Open the code with your text editor and read the code.
   Identify the different functions and classes and try to understand what they
   do.

   <Image
     src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/viewPageSource.png"
     width="579"
     height="341"
   />

   Note: Nothing will show up on the page. But if you look at the network
   request, you should see that there is no error. To get the code, right click
   on the page and click **View Source**.

  <Spoiler>

     1. `Todo` is a class to create a todo element.
     2. `render` displays a title, a input box to create a todo, and a list of
        todo items
     3. `setupLogin` displays a login page.
     4. `setupSignup` displays a signup page.
     5. `startApp` is a function that runs when the page loads.

  </Spoiler>

> Confused by the variable symbol `$`? When you see something confusing, it is
> all the more important to stick to your foundations and evaluate **what you
> know** and make a best guess. In the code, `$` is simply another character in
> the variable name. There is nothing special about it. The author put `$` in
> the variable name to help him quickly understand that the variable stores an
> HTML element.

2. In `startApp` function, send a `GET` request to
   `[https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/sessions](https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/sessions)`.
   Observe the network request, notice the response status code. The body of the
   response is JSON.

   <Image
     src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/error.png"
     width="1125"
     height="378"
   />

   If the response JSON result has an `error` key, run the `setupLogin` function
   to render the login page and stop the function.

   **Note:** This exercise is asking you to write the `fetch` request code to
   send the requests.

  <Spoiler>

  ```jsx
  const startApp = () => {
    fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/sessions')
      .then(r => {
        return r.json()
      })
      .then(body => {
        if (body.error) {
          return setupLogin()
        }
      })
  }
  ```

  </Spoiler>

3. We can't login, because we don't have an account. Thankfully there is a
   `Signup` link. If you look at the code, clicking on Signup will run the
   `setupSignup` function. Let's create an account! Send a `POST` request to
   [`https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/users`](https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/users)
   when the signup button is clicked. Leave the body empty for now and look at
   the network request.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/users', {
     method: 'POST'
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

   Notice how the response code is `400` and the response body is a JSON telling
   you what is wrong.

   <Image
     src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/code400.png"
     width="1263"
     height="381"
   />

   Send the input fields to your request body and try to get a successful
   response. When sending password, please do not send your password directly.
   Somebody may be looking over your shoulder and see your network request and
   accidentally see your password! To prevent this, you can do a simple encoding
   by running `btoa` function before sending your password with `fetch`

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/users', {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({
       username: $username.value,
       name: $name.value,
       email: $email.value,
       password: btoa($password.value)
     })
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

   If you face issues, you may need to look at the `request` you are sending to
   the API. You are sending JSON and the server needs to know that. Is your
   request's `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`?

   <Image
     src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/contentType.png"
     width="1296"
     height="662"
   />

   To do this, pass in a header attribute into the second argument object.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   fetch('...url...', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'content-type': 'application/json'
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({})
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

   If everything goes well, you should see a `200` response code. You should
   also see the a `Set-Cookie` response header to tell your browser to set a
   cookie.

   <Image
     src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/contentType.png"
     width="1279"
     height="579"
   />

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   $submit.addEventListener('click', () => {
     fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/users', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'content-type': 'application/json'
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         username: $username.value,
         email: $email.value,
         name: $name.value,
         password: btoa($password.value)
       })
     })
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

4. To check whether your browser successfully followed the response instruction
   to set a cookie, go to the API hostname and click on Storage tab. On Chrome
   it would be Application tab.

   Cookies are set against hostnames. Since you are sending a request to
   `[https://js5.c0d3.com](https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/sessions)`, you must go
   there first and then look at the cookie.

   No cookie! Usually a cookie is automatically set, but for **cross-origin**
   requests you must pass in a `credentials: 'include'` property to tell the
   browser to respect the `set-cookie` response header.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   $submit.addEventListener('click', () => {
     fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/users', {
       method: 'POST',
       credentials: 'include',
       headers: {
         'content-type': 'application/json'
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         username: $username.value,
         email: $email.value,
         name: $name.value,
         password: btoa($password.value)
       })
     })
   })
   ```

5. Add `credentials: 'include'` key to the `GET` request in your `startApp`
   function.

   <Image
     src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/credentials.png"
     width="1059"
     height="535"
   />

   Notice how the request now has a `cookie` header. The browser is sending
   cookie to the server. Notice how the server recognized who is sending the
   request so it sends back a `304` or a `200` status code instead of a `403`.
   If you look at the response body, you will see that it now contains your
   information!

   If the `GET` request has your username, set the global variable
   `globalUsername` to your username and run the `render` function.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const startApp = () => {
     fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/session', {
       credentials: 'include'
     })
       .then(r => {
         return r.json()
       })
       .then(body => {
         if (body.error) {
           return setupLogin()
         }
         if (body.username) {
           globalUsername = body.username
           render()
         }
       })
   }
   ```

   </Spoiler>

6. Add to your signup functionality so that if a user successfully signs up, you
   set the `globalUsername` variable and run the `render` function.

   Send a `POST` request to
   `[https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/sessions](https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/sessions)`
   for to login correctly.

   To delete your cookie so you can visit any page on the API hostname, go to
   the cookie section, right click and select delete.

   // setupLogin function click event
   $submit.addEventListener('click', () => {
     fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/sessions', {
       method: 'POST',
       credentials: 'include',
       headers: {
         'content-type': 'application/json'
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         username: $username.value,
         password: btoa($password.value)
       })
     })
       .then(response => {
         console.log(response.status)
         return response.json()
       })
       .then(body => {
         if (body.username) {
           globalUsername = body.username
           render()
         }
       })
   })

   // Inside setupSignup function click event
   $submit.addEventListener('click', () => {
     fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/auth/api/users', {
       method: 'POST',
       credentials: 'include',
       headers: {
         'content-type': 'application/json'
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         username: $username.value,
         email: $email.value,
         name: $name.value,
         password: btoa($password.value)
       })
     })
       .then(response => {
         console.log(response.status)
         return response.json()
       })
       .then(body => {
         if (body.username) {
           globalUsername = body.username
           render()
         }
       })
   })
   ```

7. When you type Enter into the input box, create a todo item by sending a
   `POST` request to:

   `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`

   Start by sending an empty body, then use the response status code and body
   from the server to figure out how to create a todo item correctly.

   Once you get a successful response, refresh the page by calling `render`
   function.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   if (e.key === 'Enter') {
     fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos', {
       credentials: 'include',
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'content-type': 'application/json'
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         text: input.value
       })
     })
       .then(r => {
         return r.json()
       })
       .then(render)
   }
   ```

   </Spoiler>

8. When `render` is called, get all the todo items by sending a `GET` request
   to:

   `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`

   When you receive the array of todo items (make sure you create a few of them
   in the previous step), create a `Todo` object with each element in the array
   and the `todolist` element.

   Notice that each todo item in the has an `id`, `createdAt`, and a `complete`
   property

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const $todolist = $appContainer.querySelector('.todolist')
   // create a Todo object like this: new Todo(element, $todolist)
   fetch('https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos', {
     credentials: 'include'
   })
     .then(r => {
       return r.json()
     })
     .then(arr => {
       arr.forEach(todo => {
         new Todo(todo, $todolist)
       })
     })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

9. When the delete button is clicked, delete the selected item by sending a
   `DELETE` request to:

   `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos/:id](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`

   Replace the end of the url, `:id` with the id value of the todo item. When
   you get a response from the server, refresh the page by calling the `render`
   function.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const $delete = todoContainer.querySelector('.delete')
   $delete.addEventListener('click', () => {
     fetch(`https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos/${todo.id}`, {
       credentials: 'include',
       method: 'DELETE'
     }).then(render)
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

10. When the save button is clicked, update the text of the todo item. When the
    text of the element is clicked, update the complete property. To update an
    item, send a `PATCH` request to:

    `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos/:id](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`

    Replace the end of the url, `:id` with the id value of the todo item. When
    you get a response from the server, refresh the page by calling the `render`
    function. Remember, `PATCH` requests should have a body containing the
    properties you want to edit.

    <Spoiler>

    ```jsx
    // Update complete property
    $h1.addEventListener('click', () => {
      fetch(`https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos/${todo.id}`, {
        credentials: 'include',
        method: 'PATCH',
        headers: {
          'content-type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          complete: !todo.complete
        })
      }).then(render)
    })

    // Update text property
    $save.addEventListener('click', () => {
      fetch(`https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos/${todo.id}`, {
        credentials: 'include',
        method: 'PATCH',
        headers: {
          'content-type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          text: $todoInput.value
        })
      }).then(render)
    })
    ```

    </Spoiler>

In some of the examples above, you may see an `OPTIONS` request that the browser
sends automatically to determine if you are allowed to send a **cross-origin**
request. Notice the response headers from the server. As of December 2019,
Chrome browser will hide the `OPTIONS` request, so you must use Firefox browser
if you want to see this request.

That was a lot! Please go back to review if you need to.
[Final product](https://js5.c0d3.com/todo.html). There are a few important
concepts used in the example above. The next section will go over them.

### Takeaways

A few important concepts are introduced in the example above.

- **Client Side Rendering** - Client side rendering is a coding practice where
  you change the page changing the HTML directly using JavaScript. In our
  example above, we called `render`, `setupLogin`, and `setupSignup` functions
  to render the pages. In the sections below, we will be using **Server Side
  Rendering**, where each page requires sending a request to the server.
- **Session** - A session is the duration in which a user is logged in. A
  session is created when a user logs in, and that session is deleted when the
  user logs out.
- **Cross Site Request** - A cross site request is a request that the browser
  sends that goes to a different hostname than the site that it is currently on.
  In the example above, you are on your computer's file system and requests are
  sent to [js5.c0d3.com](http://js5.c0d3.com) (different domain). In the
  sections below, we will not be sending cross site requests.

### REST

In the example above, you may have noticed a pattern in the URL when you get,
create, update, and delete todos:

- POST -
  `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`
- GET -
  `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`
- PATCH -
  `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos/:id](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`
- DELETE -
  `[https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos/:id](https://js5.c0d3.com/todolist/api/todos)`

This pattern is an industry pattern called **REST**. When an API follows the
REST pattern, developers are able to understand and use the API quickly.
Although REST pattern is not required and some companies choose not to follow
it, it has become an industry best practice so it is best to practice it.

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer (not important to memorize
this) and it is a set of design principles to let you use and modify resources
on servers using APIs.

Our example only covers a subset of the full REST pattern for **todo resource.**

| Type   | Path       | Action                                                               | Body |
| ------ | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--- |
| Get    | /todos     | Get a list of all the todo items                                     | No   |
| GET    | /todos/:id | Get data about a todo with the id, :id                               | No   |
| POST   | /todos     | Create a new todo                                                    | Yes  |
| PUT    | /todos/:id | Replace data about an existing todo with the id or create a new todo | Yes  |
| PATCH  | /todos/:id | Update one attribute about the todo with the id, :id                 | Yes  |
| DELETE | /todos/:id | Deletes the todo with the id, :id                                    | No   |

Our example also showed a create API for the **user resource** when a user signs
up.

| Type   | Path       | Action                                               | Body |     | Body |
| ------ | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :--- | --- | ---- |
| GET    | /users     | Get list of all users                                | No   |
| GET    | /users:id  | Get data about a user with the id, :id               | No   |
| POST   | /users     | Create a new user                                    | Yes  |
| PUT    | /users/:id | Replace data about a user with the id, :id           | Yes  |
| PATCH  | /users/:id | Update one attribute about the user with the id, :id | Yes  |
| DELETE | /users/:id | Deletes the user with the id, :id                    | No   |

For a given resource, note that the path is always in the plural form.

You must memorize the REST API convention above. The exercises below will help
you memorize them.
