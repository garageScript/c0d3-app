# Production Systems

If your website is going to have 1000s of requests every minute, you will need
to have more than one server. 1 server will simply not be able to handle that
many requests. To solve this problem, you need a proxy that forwards the
requests to multiple servers. **A Load Balancer** is a proxy that forwards
requests to different server to divide the load for each server.

C -->|first request| D[Server1]
C -->|2nd request| E[Server2]
C -->|3rd request| F[Server3]
```

Example library you can use for proxying request:
[node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy)

In the example:

- `GET` requests to `/hello` are forwarded to `192.168.1.87`
- `GET` requests to `/world` are forwarded to `192.168.1.88`

```jsx
const express = require('express')
const httpProxy = require('http-proxy')

const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({})
const app = express()

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  proxy.web(req, res, {
    target: 'http://192.168.1.87:3001'
  })
})

app.get('/world', (req, res) => {
  proxy.web(req, res, {
    target: 'http://192.168.1.88:3001'
  })
})

app.listen(80)
```

Use cases of a proxy:

- HTTPS Certificates
- Load balancing
- Securing servers so the real servers cannot be directly accessible

## HTTPS

You can no longer serve traffic on `http` for security reasons. Browsers will
only allow `https` requests to go through by default. To enable https, you must
provide a certificate to prove that you own the domain name. This certificate
comes in two parts: Key and Cert. There are many tools like
[acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) to help you generate
certificates quickly for free, powered by
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

Let's Encrypt signs the certificates for you to verify the authenticity of these
certificates. All browsers trust certificates signed by Let's Encrypt, but if
you are behind a corporate network, your company may not allow access to
websites signed by Let's Encrypt.

Once you have your certificate files, you can start your app like this

```jsx
const express = require('express')
const fs = require('fs')
const https = require('https')
const app = express()

const server = https.createServer(
  {
    key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('server.cert')
  },
  app
)

server.listen(443, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 443! Go to https://localhost:443/')
})
```

Listening to port `443` may require you to run your application with `sudo`.
Since only 1 application can run on a port, if you need more servers handling
your traffic, you need a proxy that listens to port `443` and sends back the
HTTPS certificates, then proxies the request to the server.

[MyProxy](https://dev.to/wolfy64/myproxy-how-to-easily-setup-free-ssl-on-your-server-1j8f)
is an application that helps you setup a proxy server, gets you a HTTPS
certificate, and helps you deploy your code quickly!

## Containers

In challenge #2: Did you see a security issue? What if someone puts in the
following command:

`rm -rf ~/`

All the files for every application would be removed. Services like
[freedomains.dev](http://freedomains.dev) hosts many people's applications. If a
user executed the command above into their app, every application would be
deleted.

This is why we need containers, so each application runs as its own virtual
machine. This way, a malicious application will not be able to affect other
applications running on the server.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a well known company that helps manage
containers. When you create a container, you may want to specify which
applications your application may need to run. Examples:

- Database like MySQL, CockroachDB, Neo4J, etc. and their version.
- NodeJS and the version that your app needs.

### Kubernetes

Containers are not only good for security, with containers, you can deploy your
application to multiple servers and make sure every server has the same code and
system setup.

If you have 1000 servers and you need to make updates, do you manually update
each one? No.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an application that allows you to upload
a container configuration, and it will deploy the container to every single
server.

## Caching

In the above examples, you stored data in both `memory` and `files`. Whenever
you create an array or object, the data is stored in `memory`. Computer access
the memory immediately.

```jsx
const data = {...data...}
const a = data.name // instant

// The slower your hard drive, the longer `fs.readFile` will take to finish
fs.readFile('...file path...', (content) => {
  ... // content is the data from the file...
})
```

In contrast, files are stored in hard drives. To get data from a file, the
computer must first find where the file is located in the hard drive and then
put the data into the memory.

In the example above, `data.name` is instant, whereas `fs.readFile` takes awhile
so you have to pass in a function to run when the reading is complete.

Some example of hard drives:

<twoColumns>

<div>
Cassette tapes: These are specialized data usually for audio recording music

<Image

  width="500"
  height="334"
/>

</div>

<div>
DVDs: These store data!

<Image src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/dvd.jpeg" width="334" height="334" />

</div>

</twoColumns>

Harddrives: Internally, it looks like a bunch of shiny DVDs stacked together.

<Image src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/hdd.jpeg" width="360" height="270" />

SSD: These hard drives are FAST. It doesn't have a spinning disk (unlike hard
drives) so finding and storing files on these can be up to many times faster
than the hard drive.

<Image src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/ssd.png" width="350" height="250" />

Since it takes time to lookup files on hard drives, `fs.readFile` function
requires you to pass in a function that gets run when the file is found and
loaded into memory.

# The Internet

When you type a url into the browser and hit enter, your browser is sending a
request to another computer (server). When your browser receives the response
from the server (usually HTML), it follows the instructions in the HTML to
display the website.

This section will go over some theory about what happens behind the scenes and
the relationship between your computer, router, modem, and the internet.

By the end of this section, you will know enough to turn your computer into a
server and make it publicly accessible by anybody with in the world with
uncensored internet access.

## Router (Intranet)

**The router** provides WIFI / ethernet ports that your computer and other
electronics gadgets can connect to. If you go to an electronics store and buy a
wireless router, you can bring it home and immediately setup a WIFI network for
your devices to connect to.

Whenever a device connects to a router, the router gives the device an **IP
Address**. An IP Address specifies the device's address. Since the router keeps
track of all devices connected to it via the IP Address, the router helps
facilitate communication between all devices.

</Spoiler>

In the above example, since all devices are connected to the same router, any
device can send a request to your computer using your computer's IP Address.

## Server

This section will show you how to create an app so your computer can start
accepting incoming requests. The most popular library to do this is `express`.
Create a JavaScript file and add the following code:

<Spoiler name="If you have problems running the app">

If the error says `express not found`, make sure you run `npm i express` to
download the `express` library and then run the app again.

</Spoiler>

After you run the app, open up a browser (on the same computer running the app)
and send a request to yourself! `http://127.0.0.1:8123`

- When your computer sees this IP Address `127.0.0.1`, it will send the request
  directly to the application listening to the specified port (`8123`)

Other devices can send a request to your application if they know your IP
Address.

### How To Find Your Device's IP Address

<Spoiler name = "MacOS">

<Image src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/mac.png" height="552" width="1165" />

</Spoiler>

If your ip address is `192.168.1.107`, any device that is connected to the same
router can send a request to `192.168.1.107:8123` and receive a response,
**Hello There** . Try it with your phone or any other devices connected to the
same router.

### Intranet

In our examples above, all devices are connected to your router but the router
is not connected to a modem (explained below). Therefore, even though devices
connected to the router can send requests to each other, none of the devices has
access to the internet. This connectivity to each other, not the internet, is
called an **Intranet**.

For security reasons, most financial companies have user's data in an intranet,
inaccessible to hackers outside the company. Only employees connected to the
company's internal network can have access to the data.

### Exercises

1. Create a server that listens to port `8124`

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const express = require('express')
   const app = express()

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('<h1>Hello!</h1>')
   })

   app.listen(8124)
   ```

   </Spoiler>

2. Create a server that supports 2 paths (`/message`, `/greeting`) and listens
   to port `8125`.

    <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const express = require('express')
   const app = express()

   app.get('/message', (req, res) => {
     res.send('<h1>Hello! You have a message!</h1>')
   })

   app.get('/greeting', (req, res) => {
     res.send('<h1>Greetings!</h1>')
   })

   app.listen(8125)
   ```

    </Spoiler>

3. Create a folder called `public`. Put some files in there. Then create a
   server that support a path `/files`. When your server receives a request,
   send back the names of all the files in the `public` folder.

    <Spoiler name = "Hint">

   When you receive a request, use `fs.readdir` to read the `public` folder
   directory.

   ```jsx
   fs.readdir('./public', (err, files) => {
     // Create your html string from the `files` array
     // Send back the response!
   })
   ```

    </Spoiler>

    <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const express = require('express')
   const fs = require('fs')
   const app = express()

   app.get('/files', (req, res) => {
     fs.readdir('./public', (err, files) => {
       const str = files.reduce((acc, fileName) => {
         return acc + `<h1>${fileName}</h1>`
       })
       res.send(str)
     })
   })

   app.listen(8123)
   ```

    </Spoiler>

4. Let's slow down your path! Support 2 paths (`/normal`, `/slow`). When `/slow`
   receives a request, send back a response after waiting 2 seconds. Make the
   user wait!

    <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const express = require('express')
   const app = express()

   app.get('/normal', (req, res) => {
     res.send('<h1>Hello! Normal Speed</h1>')
   })

   app.get('/slow', (req, res) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       res.send('<h1>Hello! Normal Speed</h1>')
     }, 2000)
   })

   app.listen(8125)
   ```

    </Spoiler>

5. After you run `express` function to create a server object, you can serve any
   files you want if you run `app.use( express.static('myFiles') )`

   In the same folder that you wrote the code for the server, create a folder
   called `myFiles` and then add some files in there (for example, `song.mp3` as
   a music file)

   ```jsx
   const express = require('express')
   const app = express()
   app.use( express.static('myFiles') )
   ...
   app.listen(8998)
   ```

   With the code above, you can go to
   `[http://127.0.0.1:8998/song.mp3](http://127.0.0.1:8998/song.mp3)` and the
   browser should play the music file

   Exercise: Create a folder called `public`. Build a website so that when
   someone goes to your website, the can see all the files inside `public`. When
   they click on the file, they view the file on the browser. (Hint: You can
   [use the `a` tag to link to files](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp))

# System Design

A list of steps to tackle system design problems. System design means to design
a system that works for the use case. We will list the steps by order:

1. **User experience** - Its important to 100% understand how the user will be
   using your app. Think about what data is needed to power their app and when.
2. **APIs** - You need to design APIs to power the user experience in step 1.
   Think about making it fast for the user. What data is static? The data that
   are not volatile can be cached locally on the browser.
3. **Scaling** - What if suddenly you have 1000 users? 1 million? 1 billion?
   1. The first thing you should always mention on the server is caching.
      Fetching from the database is the most expensive because you can easily
      have 100s of servers, but only a few databases. The more databases you
      have, the more syncing headaches you have.
      1. Eventually, you will get to the point where you need to update memory
         first, then update the database.
   2. Eventually, you will need to shard your database (split the database up).
      There are many ways to split the data. You can split by geo-location,
      time, etc. This depends on the use case (which is why #1 is so important).
   3. DNS - You need your own nameserver so that during DNS resolution, you can
      set split the request to different ip addresses so your server don't
      accidentally get overloaded.

How much load can one server handle?

1 server, 1 core, 5M readers a month. That's 160k / day, 7k / hour, around 116 /
minute.

_From HN admin - It's hard to count active users because you have to define them
in order to count them, and we make a point of not tracking people that much. We
can count accounts and unique IPs, and that's about it. But it's basically about
5M readers a month, give or take, as far as we can tell. It grows linearly, with
large swings. If you step back 10 feet from the graphs and squint, it's
basically a straight line for the last 10 years. We like it that way; we
wouldn't want to go full Haskell and avoid success at all costs, but we don't
want hockey-stick growth either. HN is not a startup!_

**_It runs on one server. Actually the app server (written in Arc) runs on one
core. But we have some caching in front of that for logged-out users._**

_Reddit is 100x bigger. It's not just that we aren't in their league...our
league is not in their league. So the comparison is a little embarrassing. It's
hard to count active users because you have to define them in order to count
them, and we make a point of not tracking people that much. We can count
accounts and unique IPs, and that's about it. But it's basically about 5M
