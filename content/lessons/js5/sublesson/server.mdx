# Setting up a project

This section will teach you the steps you need to setup a project and review
some `node` basics that you may already know. Make sure you are in a terminal.

> If in any steps you are stuck because of a running program in the terminal,
> try pressing `Control c` or `Control d` or `Control z` to terminate the
> process.

1. Create a folder. `mkdir project1`
2. Go into the folder and initialize the project.
   1. `cd project1`
   2. `npm init`
      1. If you find the questions irrelevant, type `Control c` to quit and type
         `npm init -y` to autofill the questions asked.
3. After initializing the project, you will see a file called `package.json`.

If you are unfamiliar with the 3 steps above, it may help to delete the folder
and then repeat the steps until you are completely comfortable creating a new
project.

## Package.json

Package.json contains information about your project. This is a big JSON string
(not a javascript object) so you must make sure you pay attention to your format
if you modify the file.

We will only go over the important aspects properties of this file. Feel free to
play and explore, if you mess up you can delete the project folder and create a
new one.

To start, create a file (in this example, we will use `index.js`). Open the file
and run a few `console.log` statements:

```jsx
console.log('hello')
console.log('world')
```

Run your file to make sure it works: `node index.js`

### Scripts

`scripts` section allows you to define commands. By default, you should have a
`test` property. Let's create our own script called `start` that runs our file:

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/scripts.png"
  width="513"
  height="258"
/>

Since this is a JSON string, make sure you are always using double quotes and
don't put comma for the last property in the object.

After saving the file, you should be able to run your file by typing
`npm run start` to execute the command. When your project gets bigger, it can
get pretty complicated to run your files, so writing scripts makes it easy for
developers working on the project. You can write as many scripts as you want.
[Here is an example of the scripts](https://github.com/garageScript/c0d3-app/blob/master/package.json#L4)
in C0D3's codebase.

  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/scriptList.png"
  width="642"
  height="256"
/>

<br />

### Adding libraries

If you want to add a library (`moment` for example) to your project, type
`npm i --save moment`

You will notice 3 things when you do that:

1. A new folder `node_modules` will be created if it did not already exist.
   Within that folder, you will see a folder called `moment` that contains all
   the files for moment. You may notice other folders, these folders contains
   the libraries that `moment` may need to run.
2. Your `package.json` file will have a `dependencies` section containing
   `moment`. This section will contain all the libraries that your project
   depend on.
   [Here is an example of the libraries](https://github.com/garageScript/c0d3-app/blob/master/package.json#L15)
   that C0D3 depends on.
3. A `package-lock.json` file will be created. This file not only contains the
   libraries that your project depend on, it also contains all the dependent
   libraries that the libraries themselves depend on. It also lists the specific
   version of each library. This way, everyone who works on your project will
   have exactly the same libraries.

> When you work on other people's projects, first download the code onto your
> computer. Then run `npm i` to install all the libraries (specified in
> `package-lock.json`) that the applications need. All the libraries will be
> installed into `node_modules` folder.

At this point, you should have `moment` library installed and ready to use.

1. Add `const moment = require('moment')` into your `index.js` file.
2. Run a few commands and print them out

```jsx
// index.js
const moment = require('moment')

console.log('hello')
console.log('world')

const a = moment().startOf('day').fromNow()
const b = moment().startOf('week').fromNow()

console.log('a is ', a)
console.log('b is ', b)
```

# Server

In the previous todo list exercise, you sent requests to our API to create user
session, create user accounts, and manage todo lists. In this section, you will
learn how to build your own server so you can accept requests and send back
responses.

First, create a project and add a library called `express`. There are many
libraries that can help us accept requests and `express` is the most popular.
Add the following code

```jsx
// index.js
const express = require('express') // Import the express library
const app = express() // Use the express library to create an app

app.listen(3000) // Your app needs to listen to a port number.
```

`app.listen` keeps your application running so you can listen to incoming
requests. If your application stops running, then nothing will be listening to
incoming requests. Your server is down when the application stops running. To
shut down your server type `CTRL c`

In order to listen to incoming requests, you need to provide a port number. You
can make this number up and as long as no other applications (like games, email,
messages, etc) running in your computer is already listening on the same port.
Usually it is safe to pick a number 3000 and higher.

> **Only one application** may listen to a certain port at any given time.

Using the `app` object, you can also listen for specific request method and
path.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/requestResponse.png"
  width="667"
  height="226"
/>{' '}

> The image below says the request handler function will be called with 2
> arguments, a request and a response object, for simplicity. There is actually
> a third argument which is a function. This third argument will be covered in
> the section below about middleware.

**Request Handler** - The function that runs when a request comes into the
function.

- When your request handler sends back a response, the data (like the string
  '<h1>....</h1>' in the example above), will be in the response body.

Putting it together, let's run your first server!

```jsx
// index.js
const express = require('express') // Import the express library
const app = express() // Use the express library to create an app

// Whenever a request comes in at the path `/hello`, you send back some HTML!
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('<h1> Hello world </h1>')
})

app.listen(3000) // Your app needs to listen to a port number.
```

To send a request, open your browser. In the url, type in:
[http://localhost:3000/hello](http://localhost:3000/hello)

> Remember to restart your application each time you make changes to your code
> so that your change is reflected.

For now, the only request methods you can experiment with are requests without a
body: `GET` and `DELETE` .

Sample code to send back 'ok' when we receive a `DELETE` request at the path
'/hello', and sends back HTML when we receive `GET` request at the path
'/hello'.

```jsx
// index.js
const express = require('express') // Import the express library
const app = express() // Use the express library to create an app

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('<h1> Hello world </h1>')
})

app.delete('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('ok')
})

app.listen(3000) // Your app needs to listen to a port number.
```

The first argument specifies a url path string. It also accepts other data types
and the most common url patterns are:

- `/hello` - Request handler will run specifically when the request path matches
  `/hello`
- `['/hello', '/world']` - Request handler will run when the request path
  matches either `/hello` or `/world`
- `/*` - Request handler will run for all paths

> To create a request handler for all request methods, you can use `app.use` >
> `app.use(path, requestHandler)`

### Exercises

The answers use a different variable name. Instead of `app`, you could have used
any variable.

1. [Create a get path called `/count`](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/count) that
   will tell users how many times that path has been visited.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   let visitorCount = 0
   router.get('/count', async (req, res) => {
     visitorCount = visitorCount + 1
     return res.send(`
     <h1>Welcome, this page has been visited ${visitorCount} times</h1>
     `)
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

2. [Create a get path called](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/delay) `/delay` that
   will send back a response only after 5 seconds (We are simulating a really
   slow response).

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   router.get('/delay', async (req, res) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       return res.send(`
       <h1>Your request has been delayed by 5 seconds</h1>
     `)
     }, 5000)
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

3. [GetFile:](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/getfile) Create a file with the file
   name `hello`. Create a get path called `/getfile` that sends back the file.
   Hint: you need to use node's `fs` and then `fs.readFile` to read the contents
   of the file.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   router.get('/getfile', async (req, res) => {
     fs.readFile('./hello', (err, data) => {
       if (err) return res.status(500).send('Error: Error reading file')
       res.send(`<div>${data}</div>`)
     })
   })
   ```

   If you don't enclose `data` variable inside an HTML string, then `res.send`
   will send back the literal file contents, which serves a different purpose. A
   better way to send actual files is to simply call `res.sendFile` .

   </Spoiler>

4. [Easy AB Testing](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/abtest). Create a path called
   `/abtest`. It will display "Hello World" in green 1 in 5 times. The rest of
   the times, it will display in red.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   let visitorCount2 = 0
   router.get('/abtest', (req, res) => {
     let color = '#2a2'
     visitorCount2 = visitorCount2 + 1
     if (visitorCount2 % 5 === 0) {
       // happens 1 every 5 times
       color = '#a22'
     }
     res.send(`
     <style>
     h1 {
     color: ${color};
     }
     </style>
     <h1>Hello World</h1>
     `)
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

## Request & Response Headers

Now you know how to send requests using the browser url or `fetch` as well as
listening to incoming requests and sending responses. In this section you will
explore a few important response headers and how it affects the browser.

To set a response header, we run the `set` function in the response object
before sending back a response. `set` takes in an object of the properties we
want to set.

To read a request header, we can run the `get` function in the request object
and pass in the string of the header we want.

### Cookies

In the request below, the first path is sending back a `set-cookie` response
header to tell the browser to set a header.

The second path tells the user what cookie they have.

```jsx
// index.js
const express = require('express') // Import the express library
const app = express() // Use the express library to create an app

app.get('/set', (req, res) => {
  res.set({
    'set-cookie': 'name=c0d3js5' // For cookies, you must set a key / value pair
  })
  res.send('<h1> Cookie has been set </h1>')
})

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // You may notice that cookie is a long string of cookies
  // split by ;
  // You may need to parse out the cookie key / value to
  // get the correct value.
  res.send(`
    <h1>Welcome ${req.get('cookie')}</h1>
  `)
})

app.listen(3000) // Your app needs to listen to a port number.
```

If you go to the `/set` path, you should notice that the response has a
set-cookie header.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/setCookieResponse.png"
  width="1220"
  height="404"
/>

All requests that your browser sends to your domain will have a `cookie` header
in the request.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/setCookieRequest.png"
  width="1059"
  height="549"
/>

### Cache-Control

If you want to tell the browser to save the response for a period of time so it
does not send a request to you, you can send back a `Cache-Control` header with
a value of `max-age=120`. This will tell the browser to save the response for
120 seconds.

If you have a website that millions of people use daily, your application will
receive millions of requests every day. Setting `cache-control` headers in your
response can help you reduce the number of requests you receive.

When you first load the `url` in the code below, you will notice it will take a
long time before receiving the response. The response would have a
`cache-control` header. If you open a new tab to the same url, you will notice
that the page loads instantly, meaning the browser did not send the request.

You can also send a `fetch` request to the url and see that the network request
gets the response instantly.

```jsx
app.get('/ignore', (req, res) => {
  // This helps you see if your server actually recieved a request or not.
  console.log('ouch', Date.now())
  res.set('Cache-Control', 'max-age=120')
  setTimeout(() => {
    res.send('<h1>Cached page</h1>')
  }, 3000)
})
```

2. CORS: Allow browsers in other domains to send a request to your server for
   all `/api/*` paths. Remember, this would be an options request described in
   the above section.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   router.options('/api/*', (req, res) => {
     res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true)
     res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', req.headers.origin)
     res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE')
     res.header(
       'Access-Control-Allow-Headers',
       'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Credentials'
     )
     res.send('ok')
   })

   router.put('/api/*', (req, res) => {
     res.send('<h1>put request received</h1>')
   })

   router.post('/api/*', (req, res) => {
     res.send('<h1>post request received</h1>')
   })
   ```

3. [Show how many distinct users have visited a site](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/distinct) -
   The industry standard is to use cookies to track users.

   If you delete your cookie and refresh the page, you should see the distinct
   count go up.

   <Image
     src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/deleteCookie.png"

   When setting cookie header, your string must have the `key=value` format.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const { v4: uuid } = require('uuid')

   let uniqueVisitors = 0
   router.get('/distinct', (req, res) => {
     const cookie = req.get('cookie') || ''
     const cookieStr =
       cookie.split(';').find(str => {
         return str.includes('guid=')
       }) || ''

     let guid = cookieStr.split('=')[1]
     if (cookieStr) {
       return res.send(`
         <h1>You have been identified with guid ${guid}</h1>
         <h3>Distinct Number of Visitor Count: ${uniqueVisitors}.</h3>
       `)
     }
     uniqueVisitors = uniqueVisitors + 1
     guid = uuid()
     res.set('set-cookie', `guid=${guid}`)
     res.send(`
     <h1>You have been ASSIGNED a guid ${guid}</h1>

4. [AB Testing](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/ab) - 1 in 3 visitors who visits
   your website will always see "Hello World" in red. The rest will see it in
   blue. (You must delete cookie, use incognito mode, or open up a new browser
   to simulate a new visitor)

   Setting visitor cookie for AB testing is important because you want to give
   select users the new experience throughout all the pages they visit. You can
   use cookies to set what treatment you want to give the user. In our case, we
   are giving 30% our users the red treatment.

## Request & Response Objects

This section will cover the important properties and functions in the request
and response object that you may encounter at work.

### Request

Remember the URL consists of the following parts:

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js3/urlStructure.png"
  width="480"
  height="77"
/>

Sometimes, you can specify for the path itself to be a variable by adding a `:`
in front of the variable name

```jsx
// Visit http://localhost:4098/users/billyjoel/profile
...
app.get('/users/:username/profile/:age', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.username
  res.send( `<h1>Welcome ${userId}, Your are ${req.params.age}</h1>` )
})
app.listen(4098)
```

**Properties**

The important properties in the request object that you should know are:

- `params` - An object with key / value pair based on the variables within the
  URL.
- `query` - An object with key / value pairs based on the url **query
  parameters**
- `hostname` - The hostname in the url
- `ip` - The address of the machine that sent the request.

  - Almost always, your code would be running behind a proxy like a load
    balancer (described below). Therefore, the `ip` property will be the ip
    address of the proxy, not the `ip` address of the device that actually sent
    the request. To get the original ip address, you must look at the
    `x-forwarded-for` request headers.

- `headers` - Request headers. Normally we don't access headers directly using
  this property, we use `get` function to retrieve the headers we need
  (described below)
- `body` - The body of the incoming request. This is only applicable to requests
  methods that sends data in the request body: `PUT`, `PATCH`, `POST`

**Functions**

- `get` - Allows you to retrieve to request header
  - `req.get('authorization')` will return the authorization value in the
    `Authorization` header.
  - `req.get('x-forwarded-for')` will return the ip address of the original
    machine that sent the request if the request went through a proxy.

### Response

When it comes to the response object, it is important to know the functions.

- `send` - Takes in a string and sets the response body and sends the response.
  - `res.send('<h1>hello</h1>')`
    - Sends back a response with the string in the body.
- `status` - Takes in a number and sets the status of the response. Defaults
  to 200. Returns the original response object
  - `res.status(400).send('wrong input')`
    - Sends back a response with a status code 400 and a string in the response
      body
- `redirect` - Takes in a url string and sets the response status code to 302.
  When the browser receives the response, it will send a new request to the url
  you specified
  - `res.redirect('https://google.com')`
- `set` - Sets a response header. There are two ways to use this.

  ```jsx
  // sets the set-cookie header in the response to hello.
  res.set('set-cookie', 'hello')

  // THis method of setting header is useful when you want to
  //    set more than 1 header at once
  res.set({
    'set-cookie': 'hello',
    'cache-control': 'max-age=120'
  })
  ```

- `json` - Sets the response header `content-type` to JSON and sends back a JSON
  string. Usually used for APIs to send back data.

  ```jsx
  res.json([
    {
      title: 'lesson1'
    },
    {
      title: 'lesson2'
    }
  ])
  ```

- `sendFile` - Takes in a file path and sends back a file.
  - `res.sendFile('./funny.png')` - sends back an image. Make sure the file
    exists!

### Exercises

For some of the exercises below, you would have to come up with your own paths
that makes sense to you. You should be practicing how to combine your front end
skills with the backend to be able to build complete projects.

1. [Custom Delay](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/delayed?time=2000): When user
   visits `/delayed?time=2000`, delay the `welcome` response by the specified
   number of milli-seconds in the url parameter

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   router.get('/delayed', (req, res) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       res.send(`
       <h1>Here is your response after ${req.query.time}ms delay</h1>
       `)
     }, +req.query.time)
   })
   ```

   </Spoiler>

2. [Guest Note](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/notes): When users visit
   `/messages`, they should see a list of messages. They can also add messages.
   When server restarts, you must not lose your data. Since you did not learn
   how to handle request body on the server, send the data in the url query
   parameter.

   <Spoiler>

   ```jsx
   const noteFile = './notes'
   let notes = []
   fs.readFile(noteFile, (err, data) => {
     if (err) {
       return console.log('error reading file')
     }
     const str = data.toString()
     if (str) {
       notes = JSON.parse(str)
     }
   })
   router.get('/notes', (req, res) => {
     const noteListString = notes.reduce((acc, note) => {
       return (
         acc +
         `
       <h3>${note}</h3>
       `
       )
     }, '')
     res.send(`
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/andybrewer/mvp/mvp.css" />
     <main>
     ${noteListString}
     <hr />
     <textarea class="noteInput" name="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
     <button class="noteSubmit">Submit</button>
     <script>
     const textarea = document.querySelector('.noteInput')
     const submit = document.querySelector('.noteSubmit')
     submit.addEventListener('click', () => {
       const value = textarea.value
       fetch('./notes/add?content=' + value)
       textarea.value = ''
       alert('submitted. Refreshing the page to see your message')
       window.location.reload()
     })
     </script>
     `)
   })

   router.get('/notes/add', (req, res) => {
     const content = req.query.content
     if (!content) {
       return res.status(400).send('Please provide a content query parameter')
     }
     notes.unshift(content)
     notes = notes.splice(0, 5)
     fs.writeFile(noteFile, JSON.stringify(notes), () => {})
     res.json(notes)
   })

3. [Online Users](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/online?name=hello): When user
   visits `/online?name=joe` user should see a list of all online users.

   Users will always get 401 response until they put in the name query parameter

   Display a list of users who are online (send a request every 1 second)

> Heartbeat is a concept where you send a request to the server constantly to
> get data or simply let the server know you are still connected.

## Middleware

In the previous examples, your request handlers only used two arguments: request
and response. You can actually use a third argument, which is a function.

```jsx
// Middleware to make sure every request has a cookie in order
//   to access the profile page.
app.get(
  '/profile',
  (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.get('cookie')) {
      return res.status(401).send('You are not authorized to visit this page')
    }
    next()
  },
  (req, res) => {
    const username = req.get('cookie')
    res.send(`<h1> Welcome ${username}!</h1>`)
  }
)
```

In the example above, we passed 3 arguments into app

1. path
2. A function to check if the request has a cookie header. If not, send a 401
   response.
   1. `next()` runs the next function.
3. A request handler to send back a response.

The function that checks if the request has a cookie header is called a
**middleware**. A middleware is a concept where a request goes through a
function and before reaching the main function. The function in the middle is
called a middleware.

> A **middleware** is simply a concept. It is not a special function or
> anything. It is simply a label.

The simplest middleware is the request handler in the example above.

Sometimes, you may want to run your middleware on different paths and different
request methods. In the example below, the middleware will run for all request
methods on all paths that starts with `/api`.

```jsx
// Middleware to make sure every request has a cookie in order
//   to access the profile page.
app.use('/api/*', (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.get('cookie')) {
    return res.status(401).send('You are not authorized to visit this page')
  }
  next()
})

app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.get('cookie')
  res.send(`<h1> Welcome ${username}!</h1>`)
})
```

When you use `app.use('/hello', requestHandlerFn)`, all request methods will go
through the `requestHandlerFn`: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.

If you do not pass in a path as the first argument,
`app.use( requestHandlerFn )`, that means that `requestHandlerFn` will be run
for all request methods on all paths.

Since objects are non-primitive, your middleware can also set a property on the
request. All the following request handlers will be able to use the request
property.

```jsx
let count = 0
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  req.user = {
    id: count
  }
  count = count + 1
  next()
})

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`<h1> You are visitor number ${req.user.id}!</h1>`)
})
```

At many companies, a common practice is to have a middleware to set a user
object into the request object so all request handlers can access user info
(like username, name, location, etc.) through `req.user`.

### Helper Middlewares

There are a few middlewares that are used frequently.

**Express.static**

This middleware will create a path for every file in your public folder. If you
have a picture called `c0d3.png` in the `public` folder, you can access the
picture by going to

[http://url:port/c0d3.png](http://localhost:300/c0d3.png)

```jsx
app.use(express.static('./public'))
// Question, what does express.static(...) return?
```

<Spoiler>

Since middlewares are request callbacks, `express.static(...)` returns a
function.

</Spoiler>

**[Express Session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)**

In the previous examples, we used `req.get('cookie')` to retrieve cookies and we
also set cookie headers in the response ourselves. It takes alot of work to do
cookies correctly, and express-session middleware helps you do it right! Here
are a few problems it solves:

- Cookies are insecure. To determine the logged in user sending the request, you
  cannot simply store the username in the cookie. If you did that, then any user
  could change the cookie value to be anyone else. Instead, you must secure it
  by encrypting the cookie you want to set, and decrypting the cookie from the
  request to get user's information.

  <Image
    src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js5/encryptedCookie.png"
    width="484"
    height="104"
  />

- Parsing cookies are not easy. Taking a string, separating the string by `;`
  and then getting out the key/value takes alot of effort. Express session helps
  you parse it out and gives you a `request.session` middleware.

```jsx
// setting up the middleware
app.use(session({
  secret: 'Your Encryption String',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: true }
}))

// ... Using the session from the request ...
app.get('/*', (req, res) => {
	// getting a session value
  console.log( req.session.name )

  // setting a session value
  req.session.name = 'hello....'
  ...
})
```

**Express.json**

This middleware puts a `body` property in the request object when the request
has JSON string data; a `content-type` header of `application/json` and a body
string.

```jsx
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }))
```

With this middleware, your request handler will be able to get the request body
from request methods that has a request body: `POST`, `PUT`, `POST`.

**Note** This middleware is only applicable for `application/json` content type.
There are other content-types like text, files, forms, etc. To handle those you
have to add additional middleware.

**[Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)**

This middleware helps you process file uploads and puts a `files` property in
the request object when a user uploads a file.

```jsx
const multer = require('multer')

// You must specify a folder where files should get uploaded to
// Tip: If you specify the same folder as express.static middleware
//    then every file you upload will be available on the website
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' })

// A form used for uploading file requires a key / value pair.
//   Below, we are assuming the key is called keyname
app.post('/files', upload.array('keyname'))
```

Example: [Drag and Drop front end](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/dnd)

- You must run `e.preventDefault` on your drag events listeners in order for the
  `drop` event to work.
- When the `drop` event fires, you can get the files from the event object
- To upload files, you must create a `new formData()` and files. Make sure the
  array key matches your server middleware name. In our example, we are using
  `keyname` .

```jsx
<style>
.container {
  position: fixed; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
}
.container.dropping {
  background-color: #8f8;
}
</style>
<div class="container"></div>
<script>
const container = document.querySelector('.container')
const makeGreen = (e) => {
  container.classList.add('dropping')
  container.innerHTML = "<h1>Will upload " + e.dataTransfer.items.length + " Files</h1>"
  e.preventDefault()
}
const clearScreen = (e) => {
  container.classList.remove('dropping')
  container.innerHTML = ""
  e.preventDefault()
  return false
}
console.log('container', container)
document.body.addEventListener('dragover', makeGreen)
document.body.addEventListener('dragleave', clearScreen)

document.body.addEventListener('drop', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
	const files = Array.from(e.target.files || e.dataTransfer.files)
	if (!files.length) {
		return
	}

	const formData = new FormData()
  files.forEach( file => {
		formData.append('keyname[]', file, file.name)
  })
	fetch('/files', {
		method: 'POST',
		body: formData
	}).then( r => r.json() ).then(arr => {
		window.location.reload()
	})
	return clearScreen(e)
})
</script>
```

### Exercises

1. Todo API: Build a fully functional todo list API that follows the REST
   convention. Use the [uuidv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4) library to
   generate unique id for each todo item.
2. [Picture Saver](https://js5.c0d3.com/examples/webcam): Starting with a webcam
   app, send a POST request to your server with the image data to create a
   picture that you can download.

   For now, don't worry about building the webcam app yourself, just right
   click, view source, and then copy that into your own file.

   Look at the network request, you want to change the url in the `fetch`
   request to be your own url.

   The response you get back will contain the url to the image that you took.

   The image data is simply a string, in base64 encoding. Therefore, when you
   write the image to a file, you must specify that it is a `base64` string.

   ```jsx
   fs.writeFile( imagePath, req.body.img, 'base64', (err) => {...} )
   ```

# Authentication

Industry standards for building authentication.

1. When the user inputs their information (like username / password) on their
   browser, make sure the password input field has the correct type. This way,
   the password is never revealed on the screen.

   ```jsx
   <input type="password" />
   ```

2. (optional) When the user hits the submit button, make sure to encrypt the
   password. You don't want an accident where you are looking at the network
   request with your coworker and accidentally see your password. Many companies
   don't do this.
3. When sending a network request to the server, make sure to send the data via
   a POST request so the data is in the body. If you use a GET request, the
   user's username and password will be exposed to anybody who can see the
   network requests.

   ```jsx
   fetch('/api/sessions', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'content-type': 'application/json',
     }
     body: JSON.stringify({
       username, password
     })
   })
   ```

4. When you receive a user's password on the server, you should not store the
   user's password directly into your database. Instead, you need to do a **one
   way encryption**. This means that even you yourself will not be able to
   decrypt the stored user's password. To verify that a user's password is
   correct, you run the one way encryption on the password and check to see if
   the encrypted value matches what is in the database. The higher the salt
   level, the slower the encryption. The most well know library to do this is
   [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).

   ```jsx
   // During signup / password reset:
   bcrypt.hash(user_password, SALT_ROUNDS, (err, hashPw) => {
     // hashPw will be the encrypted password
   })

   // During login, when we want to compare the passwords
   bcrypt.compare(user_password, hashPw, (err, result) => {
     // if passwords matches, result will be truthy
   })
   ```

5. When you send back the user data as a response or console.log the user
   information, make sure to remove the password field from the user before
   logging. A team at facebook
   [did not pay attention](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/)
   to this and as a result, millions of user account passwords are exposed.

   ```jsx
   delete user.password
   console.log(user)
   ```

# Challenges

Congratulations! You know enough to tackle the challenges. Good luck!

# Testing

In the previous lessons you tested functions. Those tests are called **unit
tests**. You treat each function like a unit of code and you are testing each
function (aka unit) of code.

In this lesson we will learn about integration test. **Integration test** is
when you write tests that start a server, send a request, and expect response to
be a certain way. When you send a request, the server request handler could be
running many many different functions before sending back a response.
Integration tests are appropriately named because it is making sure all your
functions are properly integrated with each other.

To write your code in a way that can be tested well, you must provide two
functions: `startServer` and `closeServer` that could be run in the beginning
and the end of your test, respectively.

`startServer` will take in a port, but the port may be unavailable. Close the
connection and try with the next port number until you are able to successfully
connect to a port.

### Start Server

`app.listen` takes in an optional second argument, a function, that runs when
the connection is done. Our startServer function will use this to return a
promise that resolves.

```jsx
const startServer = port => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    app.listen(port, e => {
      console.log(`app successfully listening to port ${port}`)
    })
  })
}
```

## Integration Test

**Functional Tests** - UI testing. Example we use:
[https://www.cypress.io/](https://www.cypress.io/)

To make sure that the urls will receive requests and respond correctly, you will
write integration tests. To write an integration test, you need to make sure you
have a function to start and stop your server.

```jsx
const startServer = (port) => {
  return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
    ...
    const server = app.listen(port)
    resolve(server)
  })
}

const stopServer = (server) => {
  return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
    server.stop( () => {
      resolve()
    })
  })
}

module.exports = {
  start: startServer,
  stop: stopServer
}
```

Since starting and stopping server takes time, you need to make sure your test
doesn't start until the server is completely started by using `beforeAll()`.
Also you need to make sure you don't stop the server until your tests are done
by using `afterAll()`.

```jsx
//Test file
describe('test API', () => {
	beforeAll( () => {
	  startServer()
	})
	afterAll(() => {
	  stopServer()
	})

	it('should get all students', () => {
	  fetch(...)
	})

	it('should create a student', () => {
	  fetch(...)
	})

	it('should update a student', () => {
	  fetch(...)
	})

	it('should delete a student', () => {
	  fetch(...)
	})

})
```
