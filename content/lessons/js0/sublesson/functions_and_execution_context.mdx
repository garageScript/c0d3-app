# Functions

Have you ever had to do the same thing (like making rice) over and over again
and thought to yourself, _What if I wrote down instructions and had someone else
do this?_

Example: Instructions to make rice:

1. Get a cup, fill it with rice
2. Pour cup of rice into rice cooker
3. Add 1 cup of water into rice cooker
4. Make sure rice cooker is plugged in, and press the _cook_ button

In the computer world, the above would be called a function.

A **function** is a set of instructions written to perform a specfic task.

A function is only executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Why use functions?

You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce
different results.

Example function (This is a very bad way to write functions and is designed to
only teach a concept. Do not write functions like this)

```jsx
const greet = new Function('a', 'b', "return a + ' says, hello ' + b")
/*
In the above example, greet is a variable that is a function object.
*/

// Function objects can be run by putting () behind a function.
let c = greet('Ironman', 'Poodle') // c is "Ironman says, hello Poodle"
c = greet('base9', 'base2') // c is "base9 says, hello base2"
```

Let's break down the above example.

- **Parameters**: Variables to hold the data when function run.
- **Run**: Running a function means to execute it by adding a `()` to the end.
- **Arguments**: Data you pass into the function when you run a function. Goes
  in between `()`
- **Function body**: Code that runs when a function is run. Notice how the
  function body is a string. After the Function Object is created, the string is
  converted into JavaScript code. In the example above, the code looks like the
  following:

  ```jsx
  return a + ' says, hello ' + b
  ```

- **Return**: The result of running the function. If the key word `return` is
  not in your function body, the function will automatically return `undefined`

## Exercises

```jsx
const fn = new Function('a', 'b', 'a + b')
const result = fn(23, 2) // what is result?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('a', 'b', 'a + b')
const result = fn(23, 2) // result is undefined
// since nothing is returned
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('return 10')
const result = fn() // what is result
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('return 10')
const result = fn() // result is 10 since return 10 is executed
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x === y')
let result = fn() // what is result?
result = fn(9, 9) // what is result?
result = fn(9, 8) // what is result?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fn = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x === y')
let result = fn() // what is result? result is true
// since both variables x and y have undefined values
result = fn(9, 9) // what is result? result is true
result = fn(9, 8) // what is result? result is false
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const secret = new Function('a', 'b', 'a = a + 9; return a + b')

let b = secret // what is b?
let c = secret('base9', 'base2') // what is c?
c = b(10, 2) // what is c?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const secret = new Function('a', 'b', 'a = a + 9; return a + b')

let b = secret // b is a function object
let c = secret('base9', 'base2') // c is base99base2
c = b(10, 2) // c is 21
```

</Spoiler>

Function body written using strings is a very unpleasant way to write functions.
There is an easier way.

```jsx
let greet = new Function('a', 'b', "return a + ' says, hello ' + b")
let secret = new Function('a', 'b', 'a = a + 9; return a + b')

// Another way of creating the function object above without using strings
greet = function (a, b) {
  return a + ' says, hello ' + b
}
secret = function (a, b) {
  a = a + 9
  return a + b
}
```

## Function Return

When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing,
return the returned value, and exit the function.

If the function was called from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to the
calling statement and continue to execute the next statement. Any return value
will be passed to the calling statement.

```jsx
// Calculate the sum of two numbers, and return the result:
const sum = function (a, b) {
  return a + b // Function returns the sum of a and b
  const c = a - b // this statement will NEVER be executed
}

const x = sum(4, 3) // Function sum is called,
// returned value will be assigned to variable x.
```

## Arrow Function

Another way to create a function object is to use an **arrow function** and its
definition includes the arrow symbol `=>`. Notice the keyword `function` is
missing. This is the preferred method today to create function objects. There
are differences between `function` and `() => {}` and that difference will be
covered in JS4.

```jsx
**Syntax:**

const name = (parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) => {
  // statements
}
```

To write an arrow function and store it into a variable called `makeBasket`,
code this:

```jsx
const makeBasket = () => {
  const b = 500
  return b
}
```

You can add instructions by putting them inside `{}`. In the above example, the
function creates a variable and then **returns** its value. `return` is a
keyword to **stop the function and give a result**.

```jsx
const snitch = makeBasket // what is snitch?
const batter = makeBasket // what is batter?
```

`=` means the left side stores the right side. Since the right side is a
function, both `snitch` and `batter` are functions. Note that they don't get the
value 500, because we haven't _run_ the function yet. We'll get to that soon.

This function is more complex than the functions we have done in the examples
above:

```jsx
const fn = (a, b) => {
  let c = a + b
  if (c > 2) {
    c = 0
  }
  return c + 1
}
const result = fn(22, 1)
```

The above function is the preferred method today to create function objects.

### Exercises

Write a function named `solution` that returns a value:

1. A number (try to be creative; use some number operators like `+ - * / %`).

<Spoiler offset='1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return 5 + 2
}
```

</Spoiler>

2. A string

<Spoiler offset='1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return 'Hello' + !'Hello'
}
```

</Spoiler>

3. A boolean

<Spoiler offset='1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return !'Hello'
}
```

</Spoiler>

4. A function

<Spoiler offset= '1em'>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return () => {}
}
```

</Spoiler>

## Running a Function

You can tell the computer to carry out the instructions in a function by simply
adding `()` to the name of the function. For example, `makeBasket()` runs the
`makeBasket` function in the example above.

Running a function has many synonyms. You might hear "running a function,"
"executing a function," or "calling a function."

```jsx
const makeBasket = () => {
  return 500
}
const snitch = makeBasket // snitch is a function
const batter = makeBasket // batter is a function
const result1 = makeBasket() // result1 is 500
const result2 = snitch() // result2 is 500
const result3 = batter() // result3 is 500

/* 
IMPORTANT

result1 stores the returned value of running the makeBasket function
result2 stores the returned value of running the snitch function
result3 stores the returned value of running the batter function
*/
```

**Important**: By storing the returned value of running the function, we can now
use the `result1`, `result2`, and `result3` variables at a later time.

### Exercises

Note that not all these functions exist, so you donâ€™t need to try running them
on your computer. Just write the statements to run the functions.

1. Run a function called `alert`

<Spoiler>

`alert()`

</Spoiler>

2. Run a function called `app.get`

<Spoiler>

`app.get()`

You can make up any functions you want. Assume someone made up `app.get`
function - all you have to do is put `()` behind the function to run it.

</Spoiler>

3. Run a function called `console.log`

<Spoiler>

`console.log()`

  </Spoiler>

4. Run a function called `Object.keys`

<Spoiler>

`Object.keys()`

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const keeper = () => {
  return 5
}
let snitch = keeper // what is snitch?
snitch = !keeper // what is snitch?
snitch = !keeper() // what is snitch?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const keeper = () => {
  return 5
}
let snitch = keeper // function
snitch = !keeper // false: functions are truthy, so !truthy is false
snitch = !keeper() // false: now we run the function and get 5; !5 is false
```

</Spoiler>

## Examples

Functions are the most important concept in JavaScript (more on that
[later](/curriculum/lessons/js3/objects)), so here are more examples.

**Note:** You must step through each line like a computer. Keep in mind that
values of variables change constantly.

```jsx
let points = 0
const igor = () => {
  points = points + 1
  return points
}
let luna = igor // what is luna?

luna = igor() + igor() // what is luna?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let points = 0
const igor = () => {
  points = points + 1
  return points
}
let luna = igor // luna is a function

luna = igor() + igor() // 3, because 1 + 2

/*
Be careful: Every time igor is executed, the value of points get updated.
*/
```

</Spoiler>

If a function does not return anything, `undefined` is returned. `undefined` is
a JavaScript primitive data type. Note that `undefined` is falsy.

```jsx
const carrotCakeRecipe = () => {}
let snitch = carrotCakeRecipe() // snitch is undefined
snitch = !carrotCakeRecipe() // what is snitch?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const carrotCakeRecipe = () => {}
let snitch = carrotCakeRecipe() // undefined, because carrotCakeRecipe returns nothing
snitch = !carrotCakeRecipe() // true, because undefined is falsy
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const work = () => {
  const blah = 5 + 8
}
const wage = work() // what is wage?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const work = () => {
  const blah = 5 + 8
}
const wage = work() // wage is undefined
```

</Spoiler>

You can call functions within other functions:

```jsx
let people = ''
const igor = () => {
  people = people + ' muggle '
  return people
}

const solution = () => {
  igor()
  igor()
  igor()
}

const luna = solution() // what is luna?
// what is people?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let people = ''
const igor = () => {
  people = people + ' muggle '
  return people
}

const solution = () => {
  igor() // after this function runs, people has the value: " muggle "
  igor() // after this function runs, people has the value: " muggle  muggle "
  igor() // after this function runs, people has the value: " muggle  muggle  muggle "
}

const luna = solution() // luna is undefined
// people is " muggle  muggle  muggle "
```

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name='Thought process'>

Step by step of how an engineer would think through the problem above:

1. people takes the value `''`
2. igor is a function
3. solution is a function
4. luna is.... what ever solution returns. Lets run solution
5. Gotta run `igor`. people is `' muggle'`
6. Gotta run `igor`. people is `' muggle muggle'`
7. Gotta run `igor`. people is `' muggle muggle muggle'`
8. `solution` doesn't have the word `return`. So it returns undefined
9. `luna` is undefined.

</Spoiler>

An arrow function can return anything! In the previous examples, you have seen
functions returning a string, a number, or undefined.

Can you
`Write an arrow function named solution that returns another arrow function`?

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return () => {}
}
```

</Spoiler>

Here is another fun example:

```jsx
let people = ''
const igor = () => {
  return () => {
    people = people + ' muggle '
    return people
  }
}
const luna = igor() // luna is a function
let lovegood = luna() // lovegood has a value of " muggle "
lovegood = luna() // lovegood has a value of " muggle  muggle "
// because people was changed to " muggle " from
// running the previous function.
```

## Exercises

1. Write an arrow function named `solution` that runs a function called
   `console.log` three times and return a number.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  console.log()
  console.log()
  console.log()
  return 5
}
```

</Spoiler>

2. Write an arrow function named `solution` that returns a function. When the
   returned function is called, `console.log` will run three times.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  return () => {
    console.log()
    console.log()
    console.log()
  }
}
```

</Spoiler>

## Parameters / Arguments

Sometimes, instructions might need requirements. When you write out instructions
for cooking rice, you need to make sure you have both rice and a rice cooker.

In the computer world, some functions might need additional data to run. For
example, the function `add2` would need a number first so it can add 2 to the
original number.

<twoColumns>

<Image

  width="669"
  height="226"
/>

<div>

**Parameters** are inputs into a function. When writing a function, all
parameters are simply made-up variable names that will take the value of the
respective data when the function is called.

</div>

</twoColumns>

When you run a function, the data you pass in are called **arguments**.

```jsx
const lucius = dobby => {
  return dobby + 2
}
let james = lucius(5) // james is 7, because lucius returns 5 + 2
james = lucius(5) === lucius(3) + 2 // what is the value of james?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const lucius = dobby => {
  return dobby + 2
}
let james = lucius(5) // james has value of 7, because lucius returns 5 + 2
james = lucius(5) === lucius(3) + 2 // james has true value, because 7 === 5 + 2
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
// draco is a function that takes in 3 parameters: x, y, and z

const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3) + draco(3, 2, 1) // what is the value of malfoy?
// what is the value of points?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
// draco is a function that takes in 3 parameters: x, y, and z

const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3) + draco(3, 2, 1)

// draco(1,2,3) -> points now has 3 (was 0 before); draco returns 3 + 3
// draco(3,2,1) -> points now has 5 (was 3 before); draco returns 5 + 1
// (points is no longer 3)
// malfoy is 6 + 6, which is 12
// points is now 5
```

</Spoiler>

You can pass in anything to a function! Below is an example of passing a
function as an argument into another function:

```jsx
const grindle = () => {
  return 10
}
let wald = cast => {
  return cast()
}
let grindlewald = wald(grindle)
// Explanation for the above:
// We are passing the function **grindle** as an argument into the function **wald**
// **grindle function** is the input parameter **cast** for **wald function**
// **wald** returns the result of running the **cast function**, which is 10
// Therefore, grindlewald has the value of 10

wald = cast => {
  cast()
}
grindlewald = wald(() => {
  return 10
})
// In the above example, we are passing a function as an argument into
// the function wald (like the previous example).
// However, wald is a function that does not return anything,
// so it will return undefined by default.
// Therefore, grindlewald is undefined.
```

In this example, we will call the JavaScript setTimeout method. The setTimeout
method calls a function or executes some code once after a specified delay (in
milliseconds).

The syntax is : **setTimeout**(_function_, _milliseconds_ ).

Note: use setTimeout() to repeat the execution continuously.

```jsx
const invisible = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    return 100
  }, 1000)
}
const cloak = invisible() // what is cloak?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const invisible = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    return 100
  }, 1000)
}
const cloak = invisible() // cloak is undefined
// invisible function first runs the setTimeout function with
//  2 arguments: function and 1000
// invisible function returns undefined
```

> **BEWARE**: Parameters MUST have variable names.

### Exercises

**HINT:** When you write a function, it does not matter what data types the
parameters are. Many of the following `write a function` questions should have
the same answer!

Write a function named `solution` that has:

1. a string parameter, and returns a function

2. a number parameter, and returns a function
3. a boolean parameter, and returns a function
4. a function parameter, and returns a function

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = one => {
  return () => {}
}
```

</Spoiler>

5. 2 parameters (a function and a number), and returns a function

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = (one, two) => {
  return () => {}
}
```

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name = "If your are confused...">

```jsx
const solution = (() => {}, 4) => {}
// <-- If your solution looked anything like this for number 5...
//
/*
... remember that when writing a function, you cannot use real values.
You must use variable names as parameters.

solution = (a, b) => {
  .
  .
}
*/
```

Part 2:

1. Run a function named `console.log` and pass in 2 arguments (2 strings)

<Spoiler>

```jsx
console.log('hello', 'world')
```

</Spoiler>

2. Run a function named `app.get` and pass in 1 argument (an arrow function)

<Spoiler>

```jsx
app.get(() => {})
```

</Spoiler>

3. Run a function named `setTimeout` and pass in 2 arguments (an arrow function
   and a number)

<Spoiler>

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {}, 1000)
```

## Functions with Conditional Behavior

Remember that to execute code conditionally, you use an `if` statement, which
looks like the following:

```jsx
if (<condition>)
   {instructions to run}
```

A truthy or falsy value goes inside the parentheses.

The code inside the curly brackets will execute if the value inside the
parentheses is truthy. Below are a few examples with functions:

```jsx
const remember = events => {
  if (events > 5) {
    return 'well done'
  }
  return 'fail'
}

let result = remember(0) // result will be "fail"
result = remember(20) // result will be "well done"
```

```jsx
const newt = x => {
  if (x === 5) {
    return 13
  }
  return x + 1
}
let tonks = newt(3) // what is the value of tonks?
tonks = newt(11) // what is the value of tonks?
tonks = newt(5) // what is the value of tonks?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const newt = x => {
  if (x === 5) {
    return 13
  }
  return x + 1
}
let tonks = newt(3) // 4
tonks = newt(11) // 12
tonks = newt(5) // 13
```

const neville = (long, bottom) => {
  if (long > bottom) {
    long = long + 3
  }
  return long

hermione = neville(9, 2) // what is hermione?
```

```jsx
const neville = (long, bottom) => {

# Execution Context

Let's explore what happens when the following function is run, step by step.

Before the computer runs your code, it first creates a box to store all the
variables. We call this box the **global** **execution context**.

Every time the computer runs a function, it will create a new box inside the box
where the function was created (after you understand this, replace the word
**box** with **execution context**). Let's use the following example:

Before the computer runs the code, it first creates a global execution context.

<twoColumns>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3)
const mal2 = draco(3, 2, 1)
```

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution11.png"
  height="258"
  width="400"
/>

</twoColumns>

**Line 1 - create a global variable named points. Line 2 - create a global
variable named draco.**

<twoColumns>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
...
...
```

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/foundations/execution12.png"
  height="258"
  width="400"
/>

</twoColumns>

**Line 6 - Run the draco function with 1,2,3.**

Remember, every time a function is run, a box (**local or functional execution
context**) is created. Since there are 3 parameters, this local execution
context has 3 local variables.

<twoColumns>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
const malfoy = draco(1,2,3) // line 6
...
```

**Line 3: Inside the draco function, the gobal variable `points` in the global
execution context is updated to 3.**

<twoColumns>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky  // line 3
  ...
}
const malfoy = draco(1,2,3)
...
```

**Line 4: draco function returns 6** - Function is done, line 6 continues, and
malfoy takes the value of 6. The local execution context for draco function is
removed and is no longer accessible.

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy  // line 4
}
const malfoy = draco(1,2,3)  // line 6
...
```

**Line 7: Run draco function with 3,2,1**

Remember, every time a function is run, a new **local execution context** is
created. Since there are 3 parameters, this new local execution context has 3
local variables:

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy
}
const malfoy = draco(1, 2, 3)
const mal2 = draco(3, 2, 1) // line 7
```

**Line 3: Inside the draco function. The global `points` variable is updated
to 5.**

<twoColumns>

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky  // line 3
  ...

const malfoy = draco(1,2,3)
const mal2 = draco(3,2,1)
```

**Line 4: draco function returns 6** - Function is done, line 7 continues, and
mal2 takes the value of 6

```jsx
let points = 0
const draco = (kreacher, winky, fluffy) => {
  points = kreacher + winky
  return points + fluffy // line 4

const mal2 = draco(3, 2, 1) // line 7
```

Done! Before the execution of the code ends, the global execution context has
the following global variables:

```jsx
points: 5
draco: function
malfoy: 6
mal2: 6
```

# Summary

Words you must know by heart:

> **variable, number, string, boolean, function,** **parameters, arguments,
> execution context, global**

Concepts you must know:

- How to create a variable (using `const` and `let`)
- When **truthy / falsy** properties are important
- What it means to write a function and what it means to run a function
- What `return` does
