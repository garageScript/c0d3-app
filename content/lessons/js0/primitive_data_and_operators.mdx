# Overview

Why Learn JS? JavaScript is the only language that lets you build applications
for any technology platform. The goal of the curriculum is to give you exercises
to help you understand technology at a conceptual level first, end to end:

1. Client side - mobile apps, websites, terminal UI, etc.
2. Server side - Database interactions, system design and optimizations
3. Batch - ML models and scripting

Once you understand these moving parts conceptually, you will be well prepared
to specialize in domain specific languages that optimizes for each task as you
gain more experience as a software engineer.

Before starting, please make sure you know some math!

[Numbers Math](/docs/numbers)

This will be the extent of how much you will need to know math. If you find any
of the exercises challenging, ask in person at a meetup group or in the
chatroom!

In this lesson, you will learn the fundamental building blocks of coding:

- First, we will cover **variables**, which is how computers store information.
- Then, we will cover some simple data (**primitive** **data types**) that
  computers can store into variables.
- Armed with some knowledge about data, we will talk about a data's **truthy**
  and **falsy** properties and when these matter.
- Lastly, we will dive into more complex data types like **functions**.

There will be many exercises; be sure to solve each problem by yourself first
before looking at the answer! If these concepts are new to you, please go
through the exercises in this lesson over and over again until you are confident
before continuing to the next lesson.

## How to Follow Along

**For experienced coders** - If you already know some JavaScript and wish to
skip directly to the challenges, please at least glance through the materials
covered to make sure you are not missing anything.

The instructions for submitting challenges are at the end of this document.

### Setup Instructions

Before starting, make sure you successfully follow the steps in
[**Setup Instructions**](/docs/setup).

For all the code examples provided, you should be writing and running the code
yourself to help you understand what the computer is doing. If the concept is
new to you, do not copy and paste. You will learn better if you write out the
code. Write the code into a file, then run the file with `node` (Node is an
application that understands your JavaScript file and runs it).

# Variables

If you imagine yourself doing inventory work and you have to count 20,000 items,
you will need to take a break at some point and write down where you stopped,
right? The act of storing information into your notes is equivalent to storing
data into a variable in the computer world. To do this in JavaScript, we use the
`=` assignment operator which assigns a value to the variable.

An **operator** is a symbol or a set of symbols that does something to the data
on either side of it. The assignment operator, `=`, means the left side takes
the value of the right side.

Examples:

```jsx
marvin = 0 // marvin is a variable, which stores the number 0
// console.log(marvin)
marvin = 42 // what is the value of marvin?
// console.log(marvin)

/*
The computer will ignore
EVERYTHING 
in here!
*/

hands = 89 // what is the value of hands?
// console.log(hands)
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
marvin = 0
marvin = 42 // marvin is 42
hands = 89 // hands is 89
```

</Spoiler>

The computer will ignore everything that comes after the `//` symbol and
everything within the `/*... */` symbol. Software engineers use these symbols to
write **comments** in their code. Comments explain complicated code so that
other engineers can read and understand the code better.

> If you want to check a variable's value, you can use `console.log`. Remove the
> comment from the `console.log` lines in the example above and you will be able
> to see the output when you run the file. There's no need to understand
> `console.log` now; it is explained later.

## Best Practice

Good practice means practicing good habits to become a good software engineer.
Bad practice means practicing bad habits that will negatively impact you as a
software engineer. Best practice means that you should **always** practice this
habit because all good software engineers have this habit.

In the above example, we are creating variables like this: `marvin = 0`. Even
though it works, it is considered **bad practice** because the variable
overwrites the global scope (you will naturally understand why after you start
coding, so don't worry if the reason does not make sense). Instead, you should
use `const` or `let` (explained below).

### const

`const` stands for **constant**. Use `const` to declare a variable when you
never need to change its value, like the following example:

```jsx
const points = 5
const res = points + 2
```

**Incorrect**: If you use `const` to declare a variable and then try to change
its value, you will get an error.

```jsx
const points = 5
points = 7 // ERROR
// TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'points'
```

### let

If you need to declare a variable and you might need to change its value later,
you should use `let`.

```jsx
let points = 5
points = 7
```

As a rule of thumb, always use `const` until you can't!

# Primitive Data

Variables can store all kinds of data. In this section we will be exploring 3
types of primitive data: **Number, String,** and **Boolean**. If you are
wondering why they are called primitive data, it will make complete sense when
you learn about non-primitive data (in lesson 2 about Arrays). For now, just
know that **Number, String,** and **Boolean** are primitive data.

## Number

Number allows you to work with numbers and can be manipulated using operators
such as

`+, - , *, /` (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division). Let's start
with a few examples:

```jsx
const fi = 5 // what is the value of fi?
const mission = fi + 1 // what is the value of mission?
const deed = fi + mission // what is the value of deed?
const space = 8 * 8 // what is the value of space?
const ship = space / 4 // what is the value of ship?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fi = 5 // 5
const mission = fi + 1 // 6
const deed = fi + mission // 11
const space = 8 * 8 // 64
const ship = space / 4 // 16
```

</Spoiler>

One commonly used operator is `%` (Modulus or Division Remainder), which gives
you the remainder when you divide 2 numbers. For example: `14 % 7` is `0`
because 14 divided by 7 has a remainder of 0. `13 % 7` is `6` because 13 divided
by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 6.

_If it has been a long time since you did division, there is an easy way to get
the correct result. When you see `a % b`, simply keep subtracting `b` from `a`
until you get a result smaller than `b`. For example:_

`towel = 18 % 7`: towel is the remainder

18 - 7 is 11, which is greater than 7, so we subtract again!

11 - 7 is 4, which is smaller than 7, so we have arrived at our answer. `18 % 7`
is 4.

`towel` has the value 4.

```jsx
let rem = 15 % 3 // What is the value of rem?
rem = 15 % 7 // What is the value of rem?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let rem = 15 % 3 // 0
rem = 15 % 7 // 1
```

 </Spoiler>

## Strings

A string can be words, sentences, or a bunch of characters. To make a string,
you can use double quotes `"` , single quotes `'`, or backticks `` ` ``(the key
to the left of 1 on most keyboards). It does not matter which of these 3 symbols
you use to create a string, but you cannot mix the symbols, like`"xxx'`. You
must terminate the string with the same symbol you started it with: `"xxx"`.

> Make sure you never confuse yourself between strings and variables!

```jsx
const hello = 'I have 500 bucks'
let a = 'hello' // what is the value of a?
a = hello // What is the value of a since we didn't use quotes?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const hello = 'I have 500 bucks'
let a = 'hello' // "hello"
a = hello // "I have 500 bucks"
```

Strings without quotes are variables!

</Spoiler>

For now, you only need to know one operator for strings, which is `+`, used to
join strings together. For example, `'End ' + 'Game'` results in `'End Game'`.

If you encounter a variable, make sure you don't treat it like a string.

```jsx
const a = 'hello'
const message = a + 'world' // what is value of message?
const c = 5
const d = c + message // what is the value of d?
const e = '<h1>' + a + '</h1>' // what is the value of e?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const a = 'hello'
const message = a + 'world' // "helloworld"
const c = 5
const d = c + message // "5helloworld"
const e = '<h1>' + a + '</h1>' // "<h1>hello</h1>"

// Explanation for the previous example: d = c + message
/* 
Let's try to think from a computer's perspective:

c has a value of 5
message has a value of "helloworld"

so const d = c + message means
d takes the value of c joined with the value of message
Hence, d gets the value of 5 + "helloworld" which is "5helloworld".

What is 5 + "helloworld"?
The computer knows how to add number + number, or string + string.

Can I convert "helloworld" to a number? No.
Can I convert 5 to a string? Yes. "5"

Therefore, let's convert and add: "5" + "helloworld"

"5helloworld"
*/
```

</Spoiler>

Sometimes, you might find yourself adding many variables together with strings.
For example, imagine this scenario:

```jsx
const firstName = 'Tony'
const lastName = 'Stark'
const location = 'Paris'
const message =
  'Welcome to ' + location + ', ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '!'
// the variable message takes the value: "Welcome to Paris, Tony Stark!"
```

## Template Literals (Template Strings)

Try typing the variable message out like the example above, and you will realize
how painful it is. Therefore, using `+` with strings is not common.

We can use `` ` `` (backticks) and`${expression}` (placeholder) instead, which
allows us to put the variables directly into the string:

```jsx
const message = `Welcome to ${location}, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`
// Notice how much shorter it is than:
//    message = "Welcome to " + location + ', ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '!'
```

**Exercise:** Rewrite the `story` variable to use `` ` ``

```jsx
const actor = 'We'
const location = "farmers' market"

const story = actor + ' plan to go to a ' + location + ' tomorrow'

// task: Rewrite the above story variable using ` (backticks) or template literals.
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const actor = 'We'
const location = "farmers' market"
const story = `${actor} plan to go to a ${location} tomorrow`
```

</Spoiler>

## Boolean

Booleans can be either of 2 values: `true` or `false`. **Operators** like `===`
(is equal to), `!==` (is not equal to), `>` (is greater than), and `<` (is
smaller than) are used to compare the left side with the right side.

The **comparison operators** compare two pieces of data and give a boolean value
of true or false. For example:

- `"hello" === "hello"` is `true`
- `5 > 2` is `true`, because 5 is greater than 2
- `9 < 2` is `false`, because 9 is not smaller than 2

```jsx
const lupin = 5 === 5 // what is the value of lupin?
const harry = 2
const ron = 4
const ginny = harry + 2 === ron // what is the value of ginny?
const dumbledore = ginny + 'hello' // what is the value of dumbledore?
const theSame = harry !== 'harry' // what is the value of theSame?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const lupin = 5 === 5 // true
const harry = 2
const ron = 4
const ginny = harry + 2 === ron // true
const dumbledore = ginny + 'hello' // "truehello"
const theSame = harry !== 'harry' // true, because 2 does not equal "harry"

/* 
If the dumbledore = ginny + 'hello' answer is confusing for you,
review the previous exercise answer for "5helloworld"
*/
```

</Spoiler>

# Truthy / falsy

Now that you have learned a few data types, you should know that every data in
JavaScript is either truthy or falsy.

> **Every data is either truthy or falsy.**

**falsy:** There are only **six falsy values** in JavaScript. (For now, just
remember the first 3. The others you will naturally get used to with
experience):

`false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `undefined`, `null`, `NaN` (Not a Number)

**Truthy: EVERYTHING ELSE** is truthy!

To illustrate, let's go over each data type we've learned:

| Data type | Falsy                 | Truthy                                               |
| --------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Number    | 0, NaN (Not a Number) | Everything else, like -50, 100, 1999999, 0.1, etc.   |
| String    | "" (empty string)     | Everything else, like "hellofalse", "1234", "hello5" |
| Boolean   | false                 | true                                                 |

## What's the Point?

Truthy and falsy properties are required for the following operators: `!`, `||`,
and `&&`.

## Not Operator: !

This operator looks at the value's truthy/falsy property and then returns the
opposite boolean.

```jsx
const josh = !0 // Since 0 is falsy, the opposite boolean is true
// Therefore, josh takes the value of true

const hannah = 0 // Keep in mind that 0 is a falsy value
const sirius = !hannah // sirius is a boolean, with value true
const charity = !'' // what is the value of charity?
const funny = !!'' // What is the value of funny?
const bone = !!!'hello world' // what is the value of bone?
const tricks = 'hello' + !!0 // what is the value of tricks?
const zach = false
const final = zach === tricks // what is the value of final?
const semi = zach === !tricks // what is the value of semi?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const josh = !0 // true
const hannah = 0
const sirius = !hannah // true
const charity = !'' // true
const funny = !!'' //false
const bone = !!!'hello world' // false
const tricks = 'hello' + !!0 // "hellofalse"
const zach = false
const final = zach === tricks // false
const semi = zach === !tricks // true
```

</Spoiler>

## And Operator: &&

The 'and' logical operator `&&` evaluates the left and right side's truthy and
falsy values in the following order:

1. If the left side is falsy, return that value.

   ```jsx
   const c = '' && 'hello' // c will be "" because the left side is falsy
   ```

2. If the left side is truthy, return the value on the right side.

   ```jsx
   let c = 'hello' && false // c is false
   c = 'hello' && 5 // What is the value of c?
   c = 5 && 'hello' // what is the value of c?
   c = true && '' // what is the value of c?
   c = 0 && 'hello' // what is the value of c?
   ```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let c = 'hello' && false // c is false
c = 'hello' && 5 // 5
c = 5 && 'hello' // hello
c = true && '' //
c = 0 && 'hello' // 0

// fyi, when printing an empty string in the terminal/console,
// it prints a blank line. You won't be able to see the actual empty string
```

</Spoiler>

## Or Operator: ||

(In case you cannot find the `|` symbol, it usually shares the same key as `\`
and is located above the return key.)

The 'or' operator `||` evaluates the left and right side's truthy and falsy
values in the following order:

1. If the left side is truthy, return that value.

   ```jsx
   const c = 'happy' || 'day' // c will be "happy" because the left side is truthy
   ```

2. If the left side is falsy, return the value on the right side.

   ```jsx
   const c = '' || 'hello' // c will be "hello"
   ```

## Exercises

```jsx
let a = 7 || false // what is the value of a?
a = false || 'hello' // what is the value of a?
a = 0 || 'world' // what is the value of a?
a = 7 || 9 // what is the value of a?

a = 7 && 9 // what is the value of a?
a = 0 && '' // what is the value of a?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let a = 7 || false // 7
a = false || 'hello' // "hello"
a = 0 || 'world' // "world"
a = 7 || 9 // 7  (first truthy value)

a = 7 && 9 // 9  (last truthy value)
a = 0 && '' // 0
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
let cedric = 5 && 'hello' // what is the value of cedric?
cedric = 5 && !'hello' // what is the value of cedric?
const albus = 5 + 5 || 0 // what is the value of albus?
const dumbledore = 0 || 10 // what is the value of dumbledore?
const harry = albus > 5 && albus < 10 // what is the value of harry?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment     // @ts-ignore
let cedric = 5 && 'hello' // "hello"
cedric = 5 && !'hello' // false
const albus = 5 + 5 || 0 // 10
const dumbledore = 0 || 10 // 10
const harry = albus > 5 && albus < 10 //false
```

</Spoiler>

> `&&` and `||` is **not** associated with boolean `true / false`. It is more
> about choosing the left value or the right value.

## Conditional Statement: The if statement

Sometimes we might want our code to change its behavior based on certain
conditions. This happens all the time in life!

> **If** you work hard at coding, you will become a software engineer.

To tell the computer to do this, we use an `if` statement, which looks like the
following:

```jsx
if (*condition*) {
// block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

Since everything in JavaScript is either truthy or falsy, you can put anything
inside the parentheses.

The code inside the curly brackets will execute if the value inside the
parentheses is truthy. Below are a few examples:

```jsx
let a = 100 // a takes the value of 100
if (a % 2) {
  // a % 2 is 0, which is falsy,
  a = 90 // so everything inside { } will not be executed
}
const b = a + 1 // b takes the value of 101
```

```jsx
let a = 9 || 4 // 9 is truthy, so a takes the value 9 which is truthy
if (a > 5) {
  // 9 > 5 is truthy
  a = 90
}
const b = a + 1 // b takes the value of 91
```

## The else statement

Use the **else** statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the
condition is false.

```jsx
Syntax:

if ( *condition* ) {
// block of codes to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
// block of codes to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

```jsx
const total = 6
let result = ""          // declare and initialize result to empty string
if ( total < 5) {
  result = "Fail"
} else {
  result = "Pass"
*}*
```

As with coding in general, if you don't need it, don't use it!

Many engineers make the mistake of using `else` whenever they use `if`. Only use
`else` if you need to use it. You will slowly build an intuition over time, just
pay attention to your code review feedback from people reviewing your code.

# Objects

> This section (Objects) is moved here from JS3. If this section is too
> complicated, please ask for help in the chatroom

The last data type you will need to know is **Objects** and in the next section
we will start with the most important object: the `Function` Object. Other
objects will be covered in JS2-3.

Objects in JavaScript can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of
objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects like
cars, house, and people.

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
Compare it with a car, for example. A car is an object, with properties. A car
has color, design, weight, material it is made of, etc. In the same way, a
JavaScript object is a collection of properties where each property has a name
(also known as key) and a value, similar to a dictionary. The name of a property
can be any string, including an empty string. The value can be any value type,
such as a string, Boolean, number, and null, but it cannot be undefined.

So far, we have worked on the 3 types of primitive data types: number, string,
and boolean. These are called primitive data types because their values contain
only one single thing like a string, number, Boolean, or null. In contrast,
objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities, and as
such, the object data type is classified as a complex data type.

To create an object, you use the `new` keyword. Here's an example:

```jsx
// create a Person Object
const a = new Person()

// create an Array Object
const b = new Array()
```

Some of the Objects in the above example and the exercises below may not exist
in real life so if you try them out in the browser you may get an error.

**Exercises**

1. Create a Date object
2. Create a Function object
3. Create an Array object
4. Create an Object object
5. Create a EventEmitter object

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let a = new Date()
a = new Function()
a = new Array()
a = new Object()
a = new EventEmitter()
```
