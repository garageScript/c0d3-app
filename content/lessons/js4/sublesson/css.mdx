# CSS

So far, we have learned that HTML is a collection of tags, which are
instructions for the browser. `<script>` is a tag that tells the browser to run
everything inside that tag as JavaScript, which enables developers to build
interactive and useful apps (a todo list, a stopwatch, a meme generator, and
much more).

There is another special tag that enables developers to make their websites
pretty.

`<style>` tells the browser to run everything inside that tag as **CSS**, a
language that helps us make websites beautiful by changing the color, position,
and other properties of browser elements. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
Here's an example:

<CodePen id="oNZpNKe" height="265" style={{ maxWidth: 'max-content' }} />

Fortunately, CSS is a really simple language. You only need to know 3 things.

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js4/selector.png"
  height="292"
  width="361"
/>

1. **Selector**: ALL elements that match your selector will have the properties
   inside the `{}` applied to them.
2. **Properties**: Each property is separated by `;`

   For a list of available properties and possible values for each property,
   visit [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp).

3. **Values**: Values are going to be different depending on what properties you
   use.

- For **colors**, there are a few ways to specify which color you want. One is
  to use the `rgba` function. RGBA stands for red, green, blue, and alpha
  (opacity). The intensity of each color (e.g. red) goes from 0 (no red) to 255
  (as much red as possible), while alpha ranges from 0 (transparent) to 1
  (opaque, not transparent).

  In the above example, we made solid magenta using:

  ```css
  /*               full red, no green, full blue, totally opaque  */
  background: rgba(255, 0, 255, 1);
  ```

In most of the common browsers (Firefox, Chrome, etc.), you can right click on a
element and select the `Inspect Element` option to see the HTML element. You can
quickly test out CSS properties and values by selecting any element on your
favorite web page and directly changing the CSS!

/>

(Don't worry about the box model yet; this will be explained in the next
section.)

# Selection

There are many ways to select an element in the `<style>` tag to apply CSS
properties to it. Starting with the following sample HTML, we'll learn a few.

```jsx
<h1 class="mainTitle">HW</h1>
<h2 class="title2"> Easy Peas </h2>
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="title2">Hello</h1>
  <h1 class="customStyle">Hello</h1>
</div>

<input class="nameInput" type="text" />
<input class="ageInput" type="number" />
<input class="titleInput" type="text" />
<button>Submit</button>
```

## Selecting By

- Element - All `h1` elements will have the color property.

  ```css
  h1 {
    color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
  }
  ```

- Attribute - All elements with the attribute `type="text"` will have the color
  property.

  ```css
  [type='text'] {
    color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
  }
  ```

- Class - All elements with the class of `title2` will have the color property.
  This notation might look familiar from how we used `document.querySelector`.

  ```css
  .title2 {
    color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
  }
  ```

- Children - All `h1` elements that are children of a `div` will have the color
  property.

  ```css
  div > h1 {
    color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
  }
  ```

## Combining Selectors

- All `h1` elements with the class `title2` will have the `font-size` property.

  ```css
  h1.title2 {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  ```

- All `h1` elements _and_ all elements with class `title2` will have the color
  property.

  ```css
  h1,
  .title2 {
    color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
  }
  ```

## Selection States

You can tweak CSS properties that get applied based on the state of the element.
After the browser runs the code below, hover over the `h1` element and it should
change color.

```jsx
<h1 class="hello">Welcome</h1>
<style>
h1 {
  color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
}
h1:hover {
  color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 1);
}
</style>
```

These types of selectors are sometimes called **pseudo-classes.** Other options
include `:visited`, `:active`, `:focus`, and
[many more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes).

## Selection Specificity

What happens if an element matches multiple selectors that are setting the same
property?

```jsx
<h1 class="hello">Welcome</h1>
<style>
h1 {
  color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
}
.hello {
  color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 1);
}
</style>
```

Should the `h1` element be red or green? The rules that determine which selector
is more "important" (and gets to apply its properties to the element) are called
**specificity.** The `h1` element above will be green because class selectors
are more specific than element selectors.

**Brief introduction to CSS selector specificity**

There are 3 levels of CSS selector specificity and 3 levels of specificity
overrides.

The 3 levels of CSS selector **specificity** from most to least powerful:

1. ID selectors (examples: `#nice`, `#green`, `#container`)
2. Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes (examples: `.nice`,
   `[type="div"]`, `:hover`)
3. Type selectors and pseudo-elements (examples: `div`, `h1`,`::before`)

```html
<style>
  #nice {
    color: blue;
  }

  .nice {
    color: purple;
  }

  h1 {
    color: orange;
  }
</style>

<h1 id="nice" class="nice">Multiple CSS Collions (Blue)</h1>
<h1 id="nice">Id (Most Powerful)</h1>
<h1 class="nice">Class, Pseudo</h1>
<h1>HTML Elements (Least Powerful)</h1>
```

The 3 levels of specificity **overrides** ranked from most to least powerful:

1. `!important`

```html
<style>
  .blue {
    color: green !important;
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="blue">Green Important</h1>
```

The color will be green because of `color: green !imporant`

2. Inline styles

```html
<style>
  .blue {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="blue" style="color: green;">Green</h1>
```

The color will be green because inline style takes precedence.

3. Ordering (last attribute read)

```html
<style>
  .blue {
    color: blue;
    color: green;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="blue">Green Ordering</h1>
```

The color will be green because `color: green` is ordered last.

<style>
.blue {
color: blue;
}
.green {
color: green;

<Spoiler>

Green because `.blue` and `.green` have the same specificity so the color is
green because `.green` is ordered after so it overrides the `.blue` styling.

<Spoiler>

Green because `div .blue` does not apply to anything on the page, it would work
for

```html
<div><div class="blue">hi</div></div>
```

though.

Notice how the CSS styling is `div .blue` (with a space). The space between div
and .blue means that div is an element and then there's a child element that has
a class called blue.

If the CSS styling were `div.blue` (no space), then the text would be blue
because `div.blue` would match to the div element with class blue and `div.blue`
would also be more specific than `.green` so `div.blue` styling would be
applied.

# Simple CSS Properties

In addition to the CSS properties covered above (`color`, `font-size`, etc.),
below are a few more common properties that can add cool effects to your pages.

## background and border-radius

<CodePen id="MWprWLg" height="265" defaultTab="css" />

- Change the value of `background` to
  `url([https://placebear.com/50/50](https://placekitten.com/200/300))` and see
  what happens!
- Change the value of `border-radius` to `10px` and see what happens!

## prefers-color-scheme

`prefers-color-scheme` is a CSS media query that detects the current theme
preference of the user's operating system.

It has two values that you can specify: light and dark.

```css
/* Light mode 
light: Indicates that the user has notified the 
system that they prefer a page that has a light 
theme (dark text on light background).*/
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  .element {
    background: white;
    color: black;
  }
}

/* Dark mode 
dark: Indicates that the user has notified the 
system that they prefer a page that has a dark 
theme (light text on dark background).*/
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .element {
    background: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

# Position

By default, most elements are rendered onto the screen starting in the top left
corner of their parent element and going one after another down and to the
right. We can use the CSS `position` property, along with the properties `top`,
`left`, `right`, and `bottom`, to precisely adjust elements' placements and
create all kinds of interesting layouts.

We'll start with 4 divs with no special positioning, which we'll adjust in the
following examples.

<CodePen id="dyvJZEW" height="562" defaultTab="js" />

The code on the left will render the above UI.

Every div is a line with height 100px.

## Relative

In the example above, we can specify a `position` property with the value
`relative` to adjust the element. For example:

As you can see, the div element with the class `.div3` is moved up `20px` and
right `20px` relative to where it was **supposed to be**. (The adjustments are
given _from_ the top left corner going down and right, so if we want to move it
up, we use a negative value for `top`.)

## Fixed

We can also specify a `position` property with the value `fixed` to adjust the
element.

<CodePen id="OJpzPXr" height="265" defaultTab="css" />

Notice that the `.div3` element **no longer occupies its default position**.
Unlike when we used `relative`, the element does not take up any space in its
default position.

With the `fixed` property, notice how the `.div3` element:

- Is 50px from the top of the browser, and 60px from the left of the browser
  - No matter how small the browser window gets (even to the point where you
    have to scroll), the element will always be 50px from the top of the browser
    and 60px from the left of the browser.
- Has a `width` property. Since this div is empty, we need to specify `width`.
  - When `position: fixed;` is applied to an element, the element becomes an
    `inline-block` element, so the width it takes up becomes like inline
    elements (only as much as its children take up). Since div3 has no children,
    if we didn't specify a width it would now have a width of `0` (which would
    make it invisible).

## Absolute

The `absolute` position value is very similar to `fixed`; the only difference is
that the `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties are relative to the
element's _parent_ instead of the window.

If you change the above example code to `position: absolute;` you may think it
looks exactly the same as fixed position. If you resize your browser smaller,
however, you will notice that as you scroll, the element does not stick to the
browser. It sticks to the parent (in this case the body), so it will scroll with
the page.

Absolute positioning is really useful if you want to position an element within
another element.

In the code on the left, pay attention to how the `.div3` element is a child
element of `.div2`.

Since `.div2` has a position property of `relative`, its children's absolute
positions are relative to `.div2`.

Notice how `.div3` is a tiny box positioned 0px from the right, and 0px from the
bottom, of its parent.

## Z-Index

What if multiple elements are all positioned in the same place? If an element
has a `position` CSS attribute defined, you can set the element's `z-index`
property to help the computer determine how the elements are ordered. An element
with a higher `z-index` will always be drawn above an element with a lower
z-index.

<CodePen id="rNypaGj" height="265" defaultTab="css" />

# Box Model

Every HTML element displayed on your page follows the **box model**. This means
that every element has a **margin** (distance between elements), a **border**
inside the margin, and **padding** within the border.

Margin vs. padding vs. border:

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js4/boxModel.png"
  height="612"
  width="1072"
/>

<twoColumns>

```css
<h1 class="box">BOX1</h1>
<style>
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  color: white;
  background: rgba(100,0,0,1);
  border: 10px solid rgba(0,0,255,1);
  margin: 50px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
```

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js4/smallBox.png"
  height="562"
  width="598"
/>

</twoColumns>

# Width

Because of the box model, the width of an element may be confusing. When you
specify the width of an element, you are setting the width of the **content**.

```css
<h1 class="box">A</h1><h1 class="box">B</h1><h1 class="box">C</h1>
<style>
.box {
  display: inline-block; /* We'll cover this soon */
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  color: white;
  background: rgba(100,0,0,1);
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid rgba(255,0,255,1);
}
</style>
```

What is the total width of each `.block` h1 element?

<Spoiler>

74px

Each `h1` element has:

- content width of 50px
- padding of 10px on each side
- a border of 2px on each side

Note that margin does not count as part of an element's width. Total: 50+20+4 =
74px

</Spoiler>

> Notice in the above example we put all the `h1` elements on one line, as
> opposed to one element on each line. When you write HTML directly and need
> precise control over your elements' widths, you might sometimes need to put
> all the visual elements on one line. This is because the browser treats line
> breaks as spaces, and this can cause your widths to be inaccurate.

At work, you may be creating many elements from the UI provided by the designer.
Calculating the width of each element can be time-consuming.

To simplify this, you can force the browser to set the width of each element to
include the padding and border by using the `box-sizing: border-box` property.

```css
<h1 class="box">A</h1><h1 class="box">B</h1><h1 class="box">C</h1>
<style>
.box {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  color: white;
  background: rgba(100,0,0,1);
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid rgba(255,0,255,1);
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</style>
```

What is the width of each `.inline` h1 element and the width of the h1 elements'
content?

<Spoiler>

Width of each element: 50px

Width of each element's content: 50 - 20 - 4 = 26px

</Spoiler>

# Display

In addition to the `inline` and `block` display options mentioned above in the
HTML Theory section, there are two other options given by the `display` CSS
property.

## inline-block

`block` elements take up 100% of the width of their parents; `inline` elements
take up only the width of their content. Sometimes, neither of these will
work—you may want your elements to take up a certain, specified width only. To
do this, you can set up the elements to have a `display: inline-block;`
property.

To understand how this property works, we can use `div`s to create 4 boxes side
by side:

<CodePen id="QWpawoN" height="265" defaultTab="css" />

Try adding the HTML and the rest of the necessary CSS for the above layout, and
then change the `display` to `inline` and `block` to see how the boxes change.

You can center an `inline-block` element by giving it a `margin: auto;` CSS
property.

- This is different from the `text-align: center;` property, which centers the
  content **inside** the element.
- In the HTML below, the `.container` is centered in the page because of the
  `margin:auto;` property. The "Hello" text is centered inside `.container`
  because of the `text-align: center;` property.

<Image src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js4/hello.png" width="634" height="98" />

```jsx
<style>
.container {
  background: rgba(50, 205, 105, 1);
  width: 500px;
  padding: 30px;
  color: rgba(255,255,255, 1);

  margin: auto;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
<div class="container">Hello</div>
```

## Flexbox

Flexbox is a display mode in CSS that lets a container (like a `div`) resize its
children as needed to maximize the use of space along an axis (horizontal or
vertical). To use this mode, you apply the `display: flex` property to the
container. To understand why flexbox is useful, we will start with the example
below.

This code has a `div` element that has three child `h1` elements. Since each
`h1` is a block element, it takes 100% of its parent's width, looking like the
following:

<CodePen id="XWMVbNq" height="265" defaultTab="html" />

What if we wanted the 3 headers to be displayed side-by-side and _together_ fill
up 100% of the space available to them (meaning they would resize when the
window changed)?

The simplest solution is to use the `display: flex` property on the box element,
then add `width: 100%` to each child element. By default, the children will be
arranged along the horizontal axis. For many more ways to use flexbox, see
[this article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background).

You can also set the `justify-content` property to elements that have
`position: flex` to position the children elements the way you want to. For the
examples below, make sure to remove the `width: 100%` property from the
`.header` CSS so you can see the effect.

```css
...
.box {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
/*
try replacing space-evenly with:
	  space-around
	  space-between
		center
*/
}
.header {
  color: white;
}
...
```

See more possible values at
[wcschools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css3_pr_justify-content.asp).

# External CSS Libraries

You can import CSS files that other people have written into your HTML. To use
someone else's CSS file, you need to use a `link` tag and set an `href`
attribute with the URL value so the browser can send a request to get the file.
In the example below, we will use the
[bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create beautiful elements. To
find out more about what classes bootstrap provides you, go to the site and
click on `Documentation`.

```jsx
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">

```

You might notice a few new attributes, like `rel` and `crossorigin`. This is
copied directly from bootstrap's site, so you don't need to know what they are
at this point.

After adding the CSS above, add a `button` tag with the class `btn btn-warning`
and you will see a beautiful button!

[This site](https://songz.c0d3.com/js4/examples/bootstrap.html#) shows a few of
the many CSS styles that bootstrap provides.

Using CSS libraries is easy and will not show up during coding interviews.
Instead, you will be tested on your core CSS abilities.

While you are learning, try not to rely on using external CSS libraries like
bootstrap.

## Exercises

Just like how you should always think about a problem before coding, when
solving CSS problems you must first think about what HTML elements you need, how
to group them together, and then how to style the elements.

To debug the CSS behind each element, you can use the browser's debugger
console.

# JavaScript & CSS

This section will give you a few examples and best practices of how to use
JavaScript to change the appearance of an element.

> **[Introduction of BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/#introduction):
> "**BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web
> development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into
> independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a
> complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and
> pasting.**"**

The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the development of a
website works with a single codebase and speaks the same language. Using proper
naming will prepare you for the changes in design of the website.

[Here is an article to introduce you to the BEM approach](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/#introduction),
which is to give names that are able to describe the names' purposes using the
right syntax(structure).

## Classes

The best practice way to change an element's appearance is to add and remove
classes. Every element has a property called `classList` that contains functions
that lets you manipulate its classes.

There are three functions to know when manipulating classes:

1. `contains` takes in a string parameter and returns true or false, depending
   if the element contains the class.
2. `add` takes in a string parameter and adds the new class to the element.
3. `remove` takes in a string parameter and removes the class from the element.

[This example](https://songz.c0d3.com/js4/examples/toggle.html) shows you how we
can use the above functions to toggle the color of the ball between clicks.

```jsx
<div class="circle active"></div>
<style>
.circle {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: rgba(255,0,0,1);
}
.circle.active {
  background: rgba(0, 255, 0,1);
}
</style>
<script>
  const circle = document.querySelector('.circle')
  circle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (circle.classList.contains('active')) {
      return circle.classList.remove('active')
    }
    circle.classList.add('active')
  })
</script>
```

Alternatively, you can also use the much simpler `toggle` function. (However,
focus on remembering the three functions above, which allow you to build more
complex functionalities than a toggle).

```jsx
const circle = document.querySelector('.circle')
circle.addEventListener('click', () => {
  circle.classList.toggle('active')
})
```

## Styling

Sometimes adding and removing classes from elements is not enough to accomplish
what you need to do, and you must change the CSS properties of an element
directly. You do this by changing the `style` property of an element. The
example code below increases the element's `width` and `height` CSS properties
by 10 pixels on every click.

```jsx
let diameter = 100
const circle = document.querySelector('.circle')
circle.addEventListener('click', () => {
  diameter = diameter + 10
  circle.style.width = `${diameter}px`
  circle.style.height = `${diameter}px`
})
```

## Exercises

1. [Caption maker for video player](https://songz.c0d3.com/js4/exercises/vidCaption.html):
   Play the video, and add some captions! Click on a caption to delete it. Some
   captions are pre-loaded for you.

A few other things you'll need to know:

- `confirm()` which is similar to `alert()` but returns a boolean depending on
  the user's choice.
- `Number.isInteger()` checks whether a value is a number or not.
- `videoElement.currentTime` gives you where the position is (in seconds).
- Timeupdate video event listener to keep track of the time in the video.

```html
<video
  class="videoElement"
  src="<https://songz.c0d3.com/js4/exercises/pubDomainRemix.mp4>"
  controls
  style="height:400px;width:400px;"
></video>

<script>
  const video = document.querySelector('.videoElement')

  setTimeout(() => {
    video.addEventListener('timeupdate', evt => {
      console.log('The current attribute has been updated: ', evt)
      console.log(video.currentTime * 1000, 'current time')
    })
  }, 1000)
</script>
```

Play the video for 5 seconds, pause it and then open the console while scrolling
through different points in the video.

**HTML**

1. Create two `div`s: one to contain the video, one to contain the caption
   editor. Create a save `button` and caption list `div`. Select them.
2. In the video container `div` add:
   - A `video` element and set its `src` to the video URL
   - A `div` for the captions
3. In the caption editor `div` add:
   - A header with the text "Add Caption"
   - Three `input:text` elements for the caption text, start time, and end time
   - A `button` with text "Save"
   - A `hr` element to provide a visual space between the caption "form" and the
     list of captions
   - A `div` to contain the list of captions

**CSS**

4. The upper (video) container needs to be center aligned, it needs a background
   color and the width needs to take up the entire page.

5. Use display: flex so that caption, start and end stay on the same line but
   have even spacing.

**JavaScript**

6. Create an array to store the captions.

- Add some dummy captions (each caption is an object with text, start, and end
  properties).

7. Create a `render` function that:

- Adds the captions to the caption list `div`.
- Adds click event listeners to each caption in the list that allow a caption to
  be deleted.

8. Add a click event listener to the save `button` that:

- Adds a new caption to the `captions` array using the values from the text
  `input`s.
- Clears the values from the text `input`s.
- Calls `render`.

9. Add a timeupdate event listener to the `video` element that:

- Gets the current video progress time from the `video` element.
- Finds the first caption in the `captions` array that is valid for the current
  video time.
- Sets the `textContent` of the video caption `div` to the text of the caption.

  [https://songz.c0d3.com/js4/exercises/arrow.png](https://songz.c0d3.com/js4/exercises/arrow.png)

<Spoiler name = "Overview">

**HTML**

1. Create a small `image`, container`div`, `img` for the mouse, and a large
   `img` tag.

**CSS**

2. Set the container's position, right, bottom. The large image should have a
   negative z-index and the mouse should have a positive z-index and position
   property.

**JavaScript**

3. Select the small image and mouse and then add a mousemove event listener that
   passes in an event parameter to the callback function.

- Grab the event's clientX and multiply it by (800/30)
- Grab the event's clientY and multiply it by (800/30)
- Set the top of the mouse to the yCoordinate.
- Set the left of the mouse to the xCoordinate.
- Set the innerText of the circle `div` to your number variable then append your
  circle `div` to your screen.
