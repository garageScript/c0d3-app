# Preflight

1. Write a function called mergeArrays that combines two arrays into one.

   ```jsx
   mergeArrays(['Rattata', 'Raticate'], ['Bulbasaur', 'Ivysaur', 'Venusaur'])
   // returns ["Rattata", "Raticate", "Bulbasaur", "Ivysaur", "Venusaur"]
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   Remember how this works? Create a solution file (like `preflight.js`) and a
   test file (like `preflight.test.js`). Make sure your solution file
   `module.exports` an object with all the functions, and your test file
   `require`s the solution file and gives the object a name (we use `fn` in our
   tests).

   ```jsx
   describe('mergeArrays function', () => {
     it('should merge 2 arrays of strings', () => {
       const arr1 = ['Rattata', 'Raticate']
       const arr2 = ['Bulbasaur', 'Ivysaur', 'Venusaur']
       const result = fn.mergeArrays(arr1, arr2)
       expect(result).toEqual([
         'Rattata',
         'Raticate',
         'Bulbasaur',
         'Ivysaur',
         'Venusaur'
       ])
     })
     it('should merge two arrays of numbers', () => {
       const result = fn.mergeArrays([9, 3, 5], [10])
       expect(result).toEqual([9, 3, 5, 10])
     })
     it('should merge an empty array', () => {
       const result = fn.mergeArrays(['Pikachu', 'Raichu'], [])
       expect(result).toEqual(['Pikachu', 'Raichu'])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const mergeArrays = (arr1, arr1) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given array `arr1` and array `arr2`.
   - Use `[...a...b]` to combine arrays `a` and `b`.
   - return new array with `arr1` and `arr2` in it.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const mergeArrays = (arr1, arr2) => {
     return [...arr1, ...arr2]
   }
   ```

2. Write a function called firstLongerThan that finds the first string in an
   array longer than the given number.

   ```jsx
   firstLongerThan(['Ekans', 'Arbok', 'Pikachu', 'Raichu'], 5) // returns "Pikachu"
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('firstLongerThan function', () => {
     it('should find a string in the middle of an array', () => {
       const arr = ['Ekans', 'Arbok', 'Pikachu', 'Raichu']
       const result = fn.firstLongerThan(arr, 5)
       expect(result).toEqual('Pikachu')
     })
     it('should find a string at the end of an array', () => {
       const arr = ['Caterpie', 'Metapod', 'Butterfree']
       const result = fn.firstLongerThan(arr, 9)
       expect(result).toEqual('Butterfree')
     })
     it('should find the first string longer than 0', () => {
       const result = fn.firstLongerThan(['a', 'b', 'c'], 0)
       expect(result).toEqual('a')
     })
     it('should return undefined', () => {
       const result = fn.firstLongerThan([], 5)
       expect(result).toEqual(undefined)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const firstLongerThan = (arr, num) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr` and a number `num`.
   - Use array helper function `arr.find()` to find the string length bigger
     than `num` and return it.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const firstLongerThan = (arr, num) => {
     return arr.find(e => {
       return e.length > num
     })
   }
   ```

3. Write a function called getReturnValues that takes in an array of functions,
   and returns an array of values returned by the functions.

   ```jsx
   getReturnValues([
     () => {
       return 25
     },
     () => {
       return 29
     },
     () => {
       return 'Pikachu'
     }
   ]) // returns [25, 29, "Pikachu"]
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('getReturnValues function', () => {
     const fn1 = () => {
       return 25
     }
     const fn2 = () => {
       return true
     }
     const fn3 = () => {
       return 'Pikachu'
     }
     const fn4 = () => {
       "I'm function four"
     }

     it('should get 3 return values of various types', () => {
       const result = fn.getReturnValues([fn1, fn2, fn3])
       expect(result).toEqual([25, true, 'Pikachu'])
     })
     it('should return an empty array if no functions', () => {
       const result = fn.getReturnValues([])
       expect(result).toEqual([])
     })
     it('should return undefined for functions with no return value', () => {
       const result = fn.getReturnValues([fn4])
       expect(result).toEqual([undefined])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const getReturnValues = arr => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr`.
   - Use `arr.map()` function to go through arrays of functions.
     - return by calling each function and storing their output in the new
       array.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const getReturnValues = arr => {
     return arr.map(e => {
       return e()
     })
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

4. Write a function called zeroSquare that takes in a number, and returns a
   square two-dimensional array with the input number rows and columns filled
   with zeros.

   ```jsx
   zeroSquare(1) // returns [[0]]
   zeroSquare(2) // returns [[0,0], [0,0]]
   /*
   [
     [0,0],
     [0,0]
   ]
   */

   zeroSquare(3) // returns [[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
   /*
   [
     [0,0,0],
     [0,0,0],
     [0,0,0]
   ]
   */
   ```

<Spoiler name = 'Hint'>

This one won't be able to use the array helper functions we've learned so
far—think recursion! Because we're dealing with a multi-dimensional array, your
recursive function will need to pass around more than just one iterator or
counter variable, and possibly more than one results array.

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('zeroSquare function', () => {
     it('should create a 1x1 array of zeroes', () => {
       const square1 = [[0]]
       expect(fn.zeroSquare(1)).toEqual(square1)
     })
     it('should create a 1x1 array of zeroes', () => {
       const square2 = [
         [0, 0],
         [0, 0]
       ]
       expect(fn.zeroSquare(2)).toEqual(square2)
     })
     it('should create a 1x1 array of zeroes', () => {
       const square3 = [
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0]
       ]
       expect(fn.zeroSquare(3)).toEqual(square3)
     })
     it('should return an empty array for 0 value', () => {
       expect(fn.zeroSquare(0)).toEqual([])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const makeRow = num => {}

   const zeroSquare = num => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given a number `num`.
   - We need a helper function `makeRow` to help us make rows in the 2D array.
   - Inside the helper function `makeRow`,
     - We need an additional variable to keep track of how many rows to build
       (let's say `i` ) which start at 0.
     - We also need an additional variable to build the row array, (let's ray
       `res`) which will start with an empty array.
     - When counter `i` equals number `num`,
       - return array `res`.
       - return `makeRow()`
     - Inside the main function `zeroSquare`,
       - We need an additional variable to keep track of how many columns to
         build (let's say `i` ) which starts at 0.
       - We also need an additional variable to store the columns and rows,
         (let's ray `res`) which will start with an empty array.
       - When counter `i` equals num,
         - return array `result`.
       - Call `makeRow` function and pass number num as the argument.
       - Push the result of above step into `res`.
       - Continue

```jsx
const makeRow = (num, i = 0, res = []) => {
  if (i === num) return res
  res.push(0)
  return makeRow(num, i + 1, res)
}

const zeroSquare = (num, i = 0, res = []) => {
  if (i === num) return res
  res.push(makeRow(num))
  return zeroSquare(num, i + 1, res)
}
```

# Overview

In the last lesson, you familiarized yourself with HTML, then learned all about
arrays. You'll want to have all the array functions at your disposal for this
lesson, so go back and make sure you've memorized them before going forward!

If you have any issues solving any of the **Preflight** questions, please review
the questions and solutions. This lesson will rely heavily on the foundations
covered in the previous lesson in three parts:

1. The first part will build on your existing HTML knowledge and introduce you
   to a couple more element properties.
2. The second part will teach you what you need to know about **objects**, a
   powerful non-primitive data type in JavaScript.
3. The third part will introduce you to **libraries** and **APIs**.

Objects are the last, but most important, data type we'll learn in JavaScript.
If the concept is new to you, remember to review frequently. After this lesson,
you will have learned everything you need to solve the algorithm section of a
coding interview and can start practicing the problems on
[leetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Make sure to follow the 5 steps for each
problem!

# HTML

In JS2 you learned about:

- The `div` tag, which we use to group elements on HTML pages
- Element properties: `innerHTML` and `innerText`

In the last lesson you learned about setting an element's `onclick` attribute to
assign a function to run when the user clicks on the element. A downside to this
method is that you can only assign one function to each element. Best practice
is to run the element's `addEventListener` function:

`addEventListener('eventName', function)`.

Let's see how our original example from JS1 would look with an event listener:

```jsx
<button class="submit1">Click Me</button>
<script>
    const button1 = document.querySelector('.submit1')
    button1.addEventListener('click', () => {
      alert("Ouch!")
    })
</script>
```

The first argument, `'click'`, is a string event that is supported in the
browser. Other events you can add events for include `mouseenter` ,
`mouseleave`, `mousemove`, and `keyup`. These events will be covered in further
details but if you want to find out other events that the browser supports, do a
search for `Browser DOM Events`

If you struggled with the HTML section in JS2 ( the previous lesson ), please
make sure you review / redo them again before starting this section. In the
exercise section, try to come up with the steps yourself before coding!

In this section, you will learn one more element and some very important
functions that allow us to work with arrays in the browser.

## Elements

### Select

<twoColumns>

<img src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js3/select1.png" />

`select` allows you to build dropdown menus. The choices go inside `option`
elements, which are **children** of the `select` element:

</twoColumns>

```html
<select>
  <option>Mild</option>
  <option>Medium</option>
  <option>Spicy</option>
</select>
```

If we have an array of strings that we want to use for the options, we can use
`reduce` to generate string tags and then set the `innerHTML` property of the
`select`:

```html
<select class="selectContainer"></select>
<script>
  const data = ['Charmander', 'Squirtle', 'Caterpie']
  const select = document.querySelector('.selectContainer')
  select.innerHTML = data.reduce((acc, e) => {
    return (
      acc +
      `
    <option>${e}</option>
  `
    )
  }, '')
</script>
```

# Browser Functions

<br />

## JSON.stringify

When websites send information to each other, the data is always sent and
received as strings. So what do you do if you need to send an array across the
Internet? You convert it to a string first!

When data (number, boolean, string, array, objects) is converted into a string,
the string is called **JSON**. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

Databases also store data as strings, so if you want to store an array of names
into the database sometimes you must convert your data to a string first.

You can turn any JavaScript data into a string with `JSON.stringify`.

_Although JSON is primarily used for working with browsers, you can also follow
along with all the below examples in node._

<Spoiler name = "Exceptions: cyclic data, which can happen in non-primitive data types, and
  functions">

```jsx
// Example of something that will throw error for JSON.stringify
const a = []
a.push(a) // a[0] points to itself
const b = JSON.stringify(a)
// Computer will get stuck trying to stringify a and throw error.

const c = [() => {}]
JSON.stringify(c)
// Functions cannot be stringified.
// Since c has a function inside, it cannot be stringified.
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const arr = [-18, 'Charizard', true]
const strArr = JSON.stringify(arr)
// strArr is '[-18, "Charizard", true]'
```

## JSON.parse

If you used the previous function `JSON.stringify` to convert an array into a
string, how do you convert the string back into an array? You use the
`JSON.parse` function. This function takes a string and **parses**, or
interprets it as JavaScript data.

```jsx
const arr = [-18, 'Peter Parker', true]
const strArr = JSON.stringify(arr)

const newArr = JSON.parse(strArr)
// newArr is an array: [-18, "Peter Parker", true]

const isSame = arr === newArr
// is isSame true or false?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
/*
false because they have different addresses.
Because strings are primitive,
when you convert an array into a string,
the address to the array is gone.

When you convert a string into an array,
the computer creates a new array (at a new address).
*/
```

</Spoiler>

## JSON

Let's review how all of this works.

JSON is the string that gets returned by `JSON.stringify` and the argument you
pass into `JSON.parse`.

JSON.stringify( data ) ——> JSON ——> JSON.parse(JSON) ——> data

## LocalStorage

LocalStorage lets you store data, like a database in the browser. There are many
ways you can make use of LocalStorage when writing a JavaScript program, and
you'll get to try a couple of examples in the next Exercise section. Here are
the two key functions you'll need to know:

**localStorage.setItem**

`localStorage.setItem` is a function that takes in 2 strings.

- The first string tells the browser which title to give the data
- The second string is the data to store

**localStorage.getItem**

`localStorage.getItem` takes in only a string, the title of the data to
retrieve, and returns the data.

**LocalStorage Example**

Here's a quick UI that lets the user add text to LocalStorage. Save this as an
HTML page, try storing some data, then reloading the page and storing
more—you'll notice that unlike what we've used to store data so far, the
LocalStorage data is persistent across page reloads. _(This script logs to the
console, so [read this](/docs/setup#running-html-codes-on-the-browser) to learn
how to open your browser's console.)_

```jsx
<input type="text" class="textBox" />
<button class="submit">Store it</button>

<script>
const submitButton = document.querySelector(".submit")
const textBox = document.querySelector(".textBox")

// First grab what's already in local storage.
// We use || '[]' to start an array the first time
//   because getItem will return null
const lsData = localStorage.getItem('mydata') || '[]'

// Turn string into an array
const dataArray = JSON.parse(lsData)

submitButton.onclick = () => {
    // Push the new text into it
    dataArray.push(textBox.value)
    // Store it back, turning it into a string on the way
    localStorage.setItem('mydata', JSON.stringify(dataArray))
    // Then console.log everything stored up till now
    console.log(dataArray)
}
</script>
```

To clear your browser's localStorage, open your browser's devolper tools and
follow these instructions:

<Spoiler name = "Chrome users">

Instead of the `Storage` tab, you should click on the `Applications` tab:

</Spoiler>

  width="1097"
  height="513"
/>

## document.querySelectorAll

Recall how `document.querySelector` selects the first element it finds that
matches its argument. `document.querySelectorAll` is similar, except it returns
an array of _all the elements_ that match the query.

```html
<div>
  <button class="hello">Hello</button>
  <button class="hello">Hola</button>
  <button class="hello">Bună ziua</button>
  <button class="hello">Aloha</button>
  <h1 class="hello">Hi World!</h1>
</div>
<script>
  const hellos = document.querySelectorAll('.hello')
  // hellos is an array of length 5:
  // [buttonElement, buttonElement, buttonElement, buttonElement, h1Element]

  const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button')
  // buttons is an array of length 4:
  // [buttonElement, buttonElement, buttonElement, buttonElement]

  // To bind an onclick to each button element, simply use forEach
  buttons.forEach((button, i) => {
    button.onclick = () => {
      alert(`This is the button at index ${i}`)
    }
  })
</script>
```

# Exercises

Some of these UI exercises may seem intimidating. When you feel overwhelmed,
take a deep breath, think about _what you know_, and make sure to start with
that. When you work as a software engineer, you will have to handle projects
that seem really intimidating. In these situations, it is important to think
about what you know and understand, then slowly branch out from there piece by
piece.

> Good engineers spend the majority of their time thinking, not coding. Whether
> you are working on these exercises, interviewing for a software engineering
> job, or working on projects, make sure you spend the first half of your
> allotted time thinking through the problem before actually starting to code.

**Debugging** - If your page is not doing what you want it to do, you can look
at the `console`. This is where the browser will try to tell you what the error
is if you've written your code in a way it can't understand.
[Read this](/docs/setup#running-html-codes-on-the-browser) to learn how to open
the browser's console.

1. [Create a dynamic select option generator](https://songz.c0d3.com/js2/1.html):
   Type a string into the input box and click the **Add** button. The string
   should show up as an option.

<Spoiler name = 'Overview'>

1. Create a `h1` , `input` , `button` and `select` HTML tags and select the
   elements by their class name. If you don't know what some of the tags do,
   read about them [at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
   and make sure you try them out.
2. set the button's `onclick` to be a function that does the following:
   - Grab the value from the `input` tag.
   - Create a string for `option` tag and add to existing select element's
     innerHTML
   - Set the select element's innerHTML to the new combined value

</Spoiler>

2. [Create a todo list](https://songz.c0d3.com/js2/2.html): Click the **Add**
   button to add a todo item. It should show up as an `h2` element. If you click
   on a **todo** item, it should be removed.

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

Because you'll be keeping the todo items in an array, and changing that array
whenever the user marks an item as complete, you'll have to reload the todo list
each time a todo item is clicked. Removing an item changes the other items'
positions in the array, so you'll also have to remake all the other items'
onclick functions. Write a function that does both of these things and make sure
it's called when adding or removing an item.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name = 'Debrief'>

**Examples:** Try adding and removing several items from various positions on
the example page (first item, last item, middle item). The other items should
reorder themselves.

**Function shape:** As mentioned in the hint, we'll need a function to load all
the todo items onto the page. This will run whenever an item is added or
removed, and has no parameters or return value. The only other function is a
quick one to add a new element based on user input. Here are those two, along
with a simple HTML template to record and display todo items:

```jsx
<h1 class="display">TODO LIST</h1>
<input class="newText" type="text" />
<button class="add">Add</button>
<div class="todoList"></div>
<script>
const list = document.querySelector('.todoList')
const inputElement = document.querySelector('.newText')
const buttonElement = document.querySelector('.add')

const render = () => {
}

buttonElement.onclick = () => {
}
</script>
```

**Think:** We'll store the todo items in an array and then turn them into `h2`
elements each time the list is loaded. Each h2 should have an onclick that makes
it go away. How do we do that? We haven't learned a way to remove the element
directly, but if we remove the item from the array and then refresh the list,
that will have the same effect. We could look through the array for the string
we're removing, but what if the user had the same item in their todo list twice?
We might remove the wrong one. So we'll include each item's current position in
its onclick function. This will change every time an item is removed, but that's
OK because the onclick functions will be rewritten as well.

**Code:** Before any of the functions use it, we should initialize the array:

```jsx
const todos = []
```

For the `render` function, there are 2 steps: turn everything into HTML and give
them their new `onclick` attributes. The onclick functions will need to call
`render` again refresh the list.

```jsx
const render = () => {
  list.innerHTML = todos.reduce((acc, e) => {
    return acc + `<h2 class="todo">${e}</h2>`
  }, '')
  const todoElements = document.querySelectorAll('.todo')
  todoElements.forEach((e, i) => {
    e.onclick = () => {
      todos.splice(i, 1)
      render()
    }
  })
}
```

All that's left is `buttonElement`'s onclick function, which will be called when
the user inputs a new todo item. We use `unshift` to add to the array so that it
will start at the top of the list.

```jsx
buttonElement.onclick = () => {
  const newValue = inputElement.value
  todos.unshift(newValue)
  render()
}
```

**Test:** Add some items and, again, make sure that whether you remove them from
the beginning, middle, or end, the other items move correctly.

Right now, our todo list is only good as long as you keep the page open. In the
next part, you'll make it a lot more practical.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name = 'Overview'>

There are many ways to solve this. Our answer is one way that we feel is more
organized. Please take the time to understand the steps.

1. Create a `h1` , `input` , `button` and `div` HTML tags and select the
   elements by their class name.
2. We need an array to hold all of the `todo` items, let's call it `todoList`

   `const todoList = []`

3. Write a function called `render` that sets the `div`'s `innerHTML` property
   to a string of `h1` elements from `todoList` array

   ```jsx
   const todoList = ['hello', 'student', 'coder']
   const result = render()
   /*
   div 's innerHTML will be set to:
   '<h1 class="todo">hello</h1><h1 class="todo">student</h1><h1 class="todo">coder</h1>'
   */
   ```

4. Run the button's `addEventListener` property and pass in two arguments:
   `'click'` and a function that:
   - Adds the input value into `todoList`
   - Run `render` function
5. Delete: Update the render function so that after the div's `innerHTML`
   property is updated:
   - Get array of `.todo` elements
   - For each element, add `click` event listener to each element. When element
     is clicked:
     - Remove the element (at that index)
     - Run `render` function

</Spoiler>

- **Part 2:** [Save the todo items](https://songz.c0d3.com/js2/2b.html) on the
  client-side using `localStorage`.

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

That wasn't too bad, was it? It only takes a few lines of code to implement
`localStorage`. When the page first loads we load existing todo items from
localStorage (using `localStorage.getItem('todo') || '[]'` in case there's
nothing there). But we need to update localStorage every time an item is added
or removed, because the user could close the page at any time.

</Spoiler>

1. Repeat the steps in part 1 of this exercise.
2. In the `render` function, add `localStorage.setItem` to update you list in
   local storage.
3. When the page loads, set `todoList` to
   `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("storedTasks") || '[]')`
   - Notice how we add `|| '[]'`so that if the `localStorage` is empty(user's
     first time on the page), we parse an empty array string instead. So
     `todoList` is set to an empty array.
4. Run the `render` function after you set `todoList` when the page loads.

- **Part 3:** [Add a filter functionality](https://songz.c0d3.com/js2/2c.html):
  Type a few characters and click on **Filter** to only see todo items matching
  what you typed.

  - strings have a `.includes()` function that takes in a string argument and
    tells you if the string exists inside the larger string.

    ```jsx
    const tropical = 'pineapple'
    tropical.includes('apple') // returns true because "apple" is part of "pineapple"
    tropical.includes('yellow') // returns false because "yellow" is not part of "pineapple"
    ```

The new function we had to add here was the Filter button's onclick. We chose to have this function filter the results, and add a parameter to render so it can render just the filtered items. A side effect of doing it this way is that if the user adds or removes an item, the filter goes away. If you wanted to keep the filter when adding and removing, you could create a new variable outside the functions to store the filter text, and then do the actual filtering inside render.

1. Please follow all the steps in the previous part(part 2) of this exercise.
2. Create an additional `button` and `input` tags and select elements by their
   class name.
3. Change `render` function:
   - Get the value of the filter input.
   - Use filter to get a new array of strings from `todoList` that has the
     strings in filter input
   - Generate string from the new Array
4. Attach a click event listener to the filter button. The function should run
   the filter function

3. [Create a storybook](https://songz.c0d3.com/js3/storybook.html), a site where
   you can read a book.

<Spoiler name = "Overview">

1. Create a previous `button` tag, next `button` tag, a with `hr` tag, add a
   `div` to store individual stories in the UI, `hr` tag, `textarea` tag to
   allow users to write their individual story, another `button` to submit
   stories and finally a `div` to display all the stories.
2. Create a variable to track a given `index`. It starts at 0.
3. Display the first individual story in the first `div` we created.
4. Create a `render` function which allows you to,
   - Empty the `div` with all stories.
   - Displays the list items into the UI.
   - Items can be deleted when they're clicked upon.
   - Updates the list every time an item is deleted.
5. Call the `render()` function.
6. Attach click event listener to submit `button`,
   - Updates the list with new user input
   - Call the `render()` and update the UI with newly added stories.
7. Attach click event listener to previous `button`,
   - When `index` is 0, return `alert` the user that they have reached at the
     beginning of the book.
   - Decrement `index` by 1.
   - Update story `div` innertext to display the current index of the list.
8. Attach click event listener to next `button`,
   - When `index` has reached to the second to the last element of the list, it
     returns `alert` notifying the user that they have reached the end of the
     book.
   - Increment `index` by 1.
   - Update story `div` innertext to display the current index of the list.

4. [Create a Friend Age Notebook](https://songz.c0d3.com/js2/3.html), a site to
   store your friends' ages. Careful, make sure to store name and age separately
   to make the next part easier.

<Spoiler>

1. Create an `h1` tag, two `input` tags for name and age, one `div` tag to
   display name and age , and an add `button`. Select the elements by class
   name.
2. Create two different arrays to store input values for name and age. Let's
   call the arrays `storeName` and `storeAge`.
3. Create a `render` function. Inside this function,

   - Attach `reduce` method to the array `storeName`.
     - Create a variable `age` inside the `reduce` method and set it current
       index of array `storeAge`.
   - Set the `innerHTML` of `div` to :

     ```jsx
     <div>
       <h2 class="displayName">${e}</h2>
       <h3 class="displayAge">${age}</h3>
     </div>
     ```

     If you are having hard time figuring out where `e` is coming from in the
     code, then please review the array method `reduce` and how it works.

4. Attach `addEventListener` to add `button`. It takes in two arguments.
   - Pass in `"click"` as the first argument.
   - Pass in a function as the second argument.
     - This function grabs the input values and stores them inside the
       `storeName` and `storeAge` arrays.
     - Runs the `render` function.

- **Part 2:**
  [ Add localStorage to store the data, then hide the age](https://songz.c0d3.com/js2/3b.html)
  (don't display it). When you click on a name, alert the friend's age.

<Spoiler name = "Overview">

1. Follow and complete all the steps from the previous part before you begin
   this particular exercise.
2. When the page loads,
   - `JSON.parse` both arrays that you have stored in the `localStorage`.
   - Run the `render` function.
3. Update your `render` function to do:
   - Hide elements from the array `storeAge` in the UI.
   - Select the `h2` element by its class name. (This `h2` element was created
     in the first part of this exercise.)
   - Attach `onclick` method to each `h2` element. This `onclick` will run the
     `alert` function which will display the age.
4. Add `localStorage.setItem` to store the updated arrays inside the event
   listener for the add `button`.
