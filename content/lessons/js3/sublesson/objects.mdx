# Objects

Objects are the most important concept in JavaScript. But wait, didn't we
[already say that functions are the most important concept in JavaScript](/curriculum/js0/functions_and_execution_context#running-a-function)?!
Yes we did. But functions are actually objects in JavaScript (and so are
arrays)! In fact, almost everything in JavaScript is an object.

Like arrays, objects can store a wide variety of data. We can imagine that an
array is like a locker room where each locker has a number. When you look into
the locker, there could be anything in there. But with objects, each locker can
have a string label. Wouldn't it be better if your locker simply had your name
instead of a number you had to memorize? The label is called a `key` and the
locker content is called the `value`.

To create an object you use `{}`.

```jsx
const student1 = {
  first: 'Harry',
  last: 'Potter',
  age: 25
}

const student2 = {
  first: 'Ron',
  last: 'Weasley',
  age: 24
}

const total = student1.age + student2.age // total is 49
```

In the example above, we created 2 student objects:

- The first object has 3 keys, first, last, and age, and 3 corresponding values,
  "Harry", "Potter", and 25.
- The second object has the same keys as student1 and corresponding values
  "Ron", "Weasley", and 25.

Then, we used `total` to show you how to access a value associated with a key.
This notation might look familiar; it turns out that by this point, you have
used many objects already.

```jsx
console.log('hello')
/*
  console is an object created by an engineer for you to use.
  console has a key called log, and the value at that key is a function.
  console.log("hello") runs the function that
  is stored in the console object under the key "log".
*/
```

Example implementation - using `console2` as the object

```jsx
const console2 = {
  log: data => {
    alert(data)
  }
}

// Now, you can run the function by calling console2.log
console2.log('hello')
console2.log('World')
```

**Examples of other objects**

- `document.querySelector`
  - document is an object created by an engineer for you to use.
  - document has a key called `querySelector`, and the value of that key is a
    function.
  - `document.querySelector('.submit')` runs the function that is stored in the
    document object under the key `querySelector`.
- `localStorage.getItem`
  - localStorage is an object created by an engineer for you to use.
  - localStorage has a key called `getItem`, and the value of that key is a
    function.
  - `localStorage.getItem('mydata')` runs the function that is stored in the
    localStorage object under the key `getItem`.

### Exercise

1. Write an object with 3 keys (make up keys and values).

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const obj = {
  name: 'joe',
  age: 940,
  isStudent: false
}
```

</Spoiler>

2. [Friend Age Notebook (part 2)](https://songz.c0d3.com/js2/3b.html): Modify
   your friend age notebook to use an array of objects instead of a 2D array.

   _If you haven’t cleared your localStorage yet, you’ll need to do it now or
   use a different key to store your data for part 2. Any data already in there
   won’t be compatible with the new object model and will show up as
   ‘undefined.’_

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

```jsx
buttonElement.onclick = () => {
  friends.unshift({
    name: nameInput.value,
    age: ageInput.value
  })
}
```

</Spoiler>

## Variables

You can also access the values of an object using the `[]` notation that you're
familiar with from arrays.

- `document.querySelector('.button')`
  - can be written as `document['querySelector']('.button')`
- `console.log('hello')`
  - can be written as `console['log']('hello')`

To get a value in an object, the code is very similar to getting a value in an
array. We pass in a string (key) instead of an index number.

```jsx
const student = {
  first: 'Harry',
  last: 'Potter',
  age: 25
}

const firstName = student['first'] // firstName has the value 'Harry'

const student2 = student
student2['name'] = 'last'
// what is student2?
// what is student?

// The benefit of using [] for getting values is that you can use variables as keys.
student2[student2.name] = 'Weasley'
// what is student2?
// what is student?
```

> The benefit of using [] for getting values is that you can use variables as
> keys.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const student = {
  first: 'Harry',
  last: 'Potter',
  age: 25
}

const firstName = student['first'] // firstName has the value 'Harry'

const student2 = student
student2['name'] = 'last'
/*
student2 is the same as student, which is:
{
  name: 'last',
  first: 'Harry',
  last: 'Potter',
  age: 25
}
*/

student2[student2.name] = 'Weasley'
/*
Notice how student2.name is a variable that contains the string 'last'
Therefore, it evaluates to 
student2.last = 'Weasley'

student2 is the same as student, which is:
{
  name: 'last',
  first: 'Harry',
  last: 'Weasley',
  age: 25
}
*/
```

## Non-Primitive

Like arrays, objects are non-primitive.

```jsx
const star = { name: 'Tarzan' }
const star2 = star
star2['friend'] = star
star2['friend']['lover'] = 'Jane'
// what is star2?
// what is star?

star['name'] = 'Sarah'
// what is star2?
// what is star?

const allStars = [star, star2]
allStars[0]['lover'] = allStars[1]['name']
// what is star2?
// what is star?
// what is allStars?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
// Section 1:
/*
star is the same as star2, which is:
{
  name: 'Tarzan',
  friend: Object,
  lover: "Jane"
}
*/

// Section 2:
/*
star is the same as star2, which is:
{
  name: 'Sarah',
  friend: Object,
  lover: "Jane"
}
*/

// section 3
/*
star is the same as star2, which is:
{
  name: 'Sarah',
  friend: Object,
  lover: "Sarah"
}
*/
/*
allStars is: 
	[
		{ name: 'Sarah', friend: [Circular], lover: 'Sarah'},
		{ name: 'Sarah', friend: [Circular], lover: 'Sarah'}
	]
*/
```

Values can be anything, including a function!

```jsx
const snacks = {
  nutella: () => {
    return 200
  },
  pixyStix: () => {
    return 9
  },
  lays: () => {
    return 135
  }
}
let calories = snacks['nutella']() // what is calories?
calories = snacks['pixyStix']() // what is calories?
calories = snacks['lays']() // what is calories?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
// calories -> 200
// calories -> 9
// calories -> 135
```

</Spoiler>

Here are some more examples with functions for you to work through. In the first
one, we introduce the building blocks of a concept called **promises** that
we'll get to later in this chapter. We'll learn a function called `fetch()` that
returns a promise object. The promise object has a `then()` property, which
returns a promise object so you can keep chaining more then() properties
together until what you want to accomplish is completed:
`fetch().then().then().then()` etc. Here we introduce this kind of behavior
where an object's function returns the object itself.

```jsx
// Problem 1:
const magician = {
  perform: () => {
    return magician
  }
}
const houdini = magician.perform().perform() // what is houdini?
const same = magician === houdini // what is same?

/* Problem 2: Create a prepareStage object with a then property so the code
	below will not cause an error.
*/

prepareStage.then().then().then()

/* Problem 3: Create the prepareStage object with a then property that
  console.logs each input: Should log Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise
*/

prepareStage.then('Squirtle').then('Wartortle').then('Blastoise')

/* Problem 4: Create the prepareStage object with a then property that
	executes its function argument: Should log Abracadabra! 3 times
*/

const performMagic = () => {
  console.log('Abracadabra!')
}

prepareStage.then(performMagic).then(performMagic).then(performMagic)
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
/* Problem 1: houdini is:
{
  perform: () => {
    return magician
  }
}
same is true
*/

/* Problem 2:
const prepareStage = {
  then: () => {
    return prepareStage
  }
}
*/

/* Problem 3:
const prepareStage = {
  then: (input) => {
    console.log(input)
    return prepareStage
  }
}
*/

/* Problem 4:
const prepareStage = {
  then: (input) => {
    input()
    return prepareStage
  }
}
*/

## Exercises

1. Write a function called addKV that takes in an object, 2 strings (key and
   value), and adds a new key and value to an object.

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('addKV function', () => {
     it('should add a key and value to an object', () => {
       const marvel = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       fn.addKV(marvel, 'antman', 'funny')
       expect(marvel.antman).toEqual('funny')
     })
     it('should add a key and value to an object', () => {
       const marvel = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong',
         antman: 'funny'
       }
       fn.addKV(marvel, 'wonderwoman', 'smart')
       expect(marvel.wonderwoman).toEqual('smart')
     })
     it('should add a key and value to an object', () => {
       const marvel = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong',
         antman: 'funny',
         wonderwoman: 'smart'
       }
       const b = ['leader', 'honest']
       fn.addKV(marvel, 'captainamerica', ['leader', 'honest'])
       expect(marvel.captainamerica).toEqual(b)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const addKV = (obj, key, val) => {
     obj[key] = val
   }
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an object `obj`, a string `key` and a string `val`.
   - Assign `val` to `obj` at a given `key`.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const addKV = (obj, key, val) => {
     obj[key] = val
   }
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

Did you try a.b = c? Remember that using a . accesses exactly the key that comes
after the .. To look inside a variable and access that key, you need [].

2. Write a function called filterNonKeys that filters an array to only include
   strings that are also keys in a given object.

   ```jsx
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'
   }
   const avengers = ['ironman', 'strange', 'thor', 'spiderman', 'hulk']
   const result = filterNonKeys(avengers, info)
   // result is ["ironman", "spiderman", "hulk"]
   ```

<Spoiler name='Hint'>

To check if a key exists in an object, just try to access it—if it doesn’t exist
you’ll get undefined, which is falsey.

</Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('filterNonKeys function', () => {
     const avengers = ['ironman', 'strange', 'thor', 'spiderman', 'hulk']
     const info = {
       ironman: 'arrogant',
       spiderman: 'naive',
       hulk: 'strong'
     }
     it('should return an empty array when filtering on an empty object', () => {
       const result = fn.filterNonKeys(avengers, {})
       expect(result).toEqual([])
     })
     it('should return an empty array when starting with an empty array', () => {
       const result = fn.filterNonKeys([], info)
       expect(result).toEqual([])
     })
     it('should return an empty array if no matches are found', () => {
       const b = ['batman', 'superman', 'flash']
       const result = fn.filterNonKeys(b, info)
       expect(result).toEqual([])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const filterNonKeys = (arr, obj) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr` and an object `obj`.
   - Use array helper method `filter` to filter out the matching keys from the
     `obj`.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const filterNonKeys = (arr, obj) => {
     return arr.filter(e => {
       return obj[e]
     })
   }
   ```

3. Write a function called addDescriptions that adds a description key to each
   object in an array. The description should go with the name that matches the
   key in the input object.

   ```jsx
   const characters = [
     { name: 'ironman' },
     { name: 'spiderman' },
     { name: 'hulk' }
   ]
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'
   }
   addDescriptions(characters, info)
   /* characters is changed to:
     [
       {name: "ironman", description: "arrogant"},
       {name: "spiderman", description: "naive"},
       {name:"hulk", description: "strong"}
     ]
   */
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('addDescriptions function', () => {
     it('should add 3 descriptions to corresponding names', () => {
       const characters = [
         { name: 'ironman' },
         { name: 'spiderman' },
         { name: 'hulk' }
       ]
       const info = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       fn.addDescriptions(characters, info)
       expect(characters).toEqual([
         { name: 'ironman', description: 'arrogant' },
         { name: 'spiderman', description: 'naive' },
         { name: 'hulk', description: 'strong' }
       ])
     })
     it('should not add descriptions to objects without names', () => {
       const characters = [
         { tonyStark: 'ironman' },
         { peterParker: 'spiderman' },
         { name: 'hulk' }
       ]
       const info = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       fn.addDescriptions(characters, info)
       expect(characters).toEqual([
         { tonyStark: 'ironman' },
         { peterParker: 'spiderman' },
         { name: 'hulk', description: 'strong' }
       ])
     })
     it('should ignore unmatched keys', () => {
       const characters = [
         { name: 'ironman' },
         { name: 'rocket' },
         { name: 'drax' }
       ]
       const info = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       fn.addDescriptions(characters, info)
       expect(characters).toEqual([
         { name: 'ironman', description: 'arrogant' },
         { name: 'rocket' },
         { name: 'drax' }
       ])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const addDescription = (chars, obj) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array of objects `chars` and an object `obj`.
   - Go through each element of `chars` and assign `"description"` key.
   - The value of `description` is the value of the `obj` at a given name.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const addDescriptions = (chars, obj) => {
     chars.forEach(e => {
       e.description = obj[e.name]
     })
     return chars
   }

4. Write a function called countOccurrences that returns an object that counts
   how many times each item occurs in an array.

   ```jsx
   const abc = ['abc', 'a', 'abc', 'b', 'abc', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'abc']
   const result = countOccurrences(abc)
   // should return: {abc: 4, a: 2, b: 2, c: 1}
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('countOccurrences function', () => {
     it('should count occurrences of strings', () => {
       const abc = ['abc', 'a', 'abc', 'b', 'abc', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'abc']
       const result = fn.countOccurrences(abc)
       expect(result).toEqual({ abc: 4, a: 2, b: 2, c: 1 })
     })
     it('should count occurrences of numbers', () => {
       const nums = [0, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2]
       const result = fn.countOccurrences(nums)
       expect(result).toEqual({ 0: 5, 3: 3, 1: 1, 2: 1 })
     })
     it('should return an empty object for an empty array', () => {
       const result = fn.countOccurrences([])
       expect(result).toEqual({})
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const count0occurences = arr => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr`.
   - Use array helper method `reduce`
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const countOccurrences = arr => {
     return arr.reduce((acc, e) => {
       acc[e] = (acc[e] || 0) + 1
       return acc
     }, {})
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

We could have also done this using `forEach`: initialize an empty object
outside, then call `arr.forEach` and pass in a function that adds to the object,
then return it after the forEach call. But `reduce` is an extremely versatile
function, and can simplify this task down to one function call.

Note that we added 1 to `acc[e] || 0` in case `acc[e]` isn't defined yet--adding
1 to `undefined` results in `NaN`.

# Object Helpers

The Object type comes with several "helper" functions that let you find and
modify objects' keys and values:

## Object.keys

This function takes in an object and returns an array of keys in the object.

```jsx
const info = {
  ironman: 'arrogant',
  spiderman: 'naive',
  hulk: 'strong'
}
const result = Object.keys(info)
// result is ["ironman", "spiderman", "hulk"]
```

Why isn't it `info.keys()`?

Most of the helper functions for Object are static functions rather than the
prototype functions we learned about for arrays. One reason is that objects
provide more opportunities for key collisions—for example your object could have
a key called keys or values.

## Object.values

This function takes in an object and returns an array of values in the object.

```jsx
const info = {
  ironman: 'arrogant',
  spiderman: 'naive',
  hulk: 'strong'
}
const result = Object.values(info)
// result is ["arrogant", "naive", "strong"]
```

## Object.entries

This function takes in an object and returns an array. Each element of the array
is an array with 2 elements, a key and its corresponding value in the object.

```jsx
const info = {
  ironman: 'arrogant',
  spiderman: 'naive',
  hulk: 'strong'
}
const result = Object.entries(info)
// result is [["ironman", "arrogant"], ["spiderman", "naive"], ["hulk", "strong"]]
```

## Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty

Notice how this method is attached to the `prototype` of **Object**. Really, all
we need to understand about this is that every _Object instance_ (which is
basically everything in JavaScript, since everything is an Object) has this
method available to them.

The `hasOwnProperty` method allows us to check if a particular property exists
**ONLY** on the object in context and not down the prototype chain of the
object. Go [here](/curriculum/js3/objects#prototype-inheritance) to read more on
prototypes.

Let's look at an example to see why we may use this method.

```jsx
const myObj = {
  name: 'test',
  age: 100
}

myObj.hasOwnProperty('name') // true
!!myObj['name'] // true

myObj.hasOwnProperty('age') // true
!!myObj['age'] // true

myObj.hasOwnProperty('height') // false
!!myObj['height'] // false

myObj.hasOwnProperty('weight') // false
!!myObj['weight'] // false

myObj.hasOwnProperty('toString') // FALSE
!!myObj['toString'] // TRUE
```

In the example above we are comparing `hasOwnProperty` _vs_ just trying to use
the `[]` notation to find a key inside of an Object. Putting `!!` in front just
allows us to convert the value into a boolean to compare the returns values.

Now, the question is why does `myObj.hasOwnProperty('toString')` return
**false** but `!!myObj['toString']` returns **true**? When you use `[]`
notation, you are looking for any property that exists on the Object **OR** down
that Object's prototype chain! Using `.hasOwnProperty()` ONLY looks at the
Object's properties.

When you start working with libraries and using Objects that have been defined
somewhere else for you, you have no idea what is defined on the prototype
chains. You may be able to get by with just checking properties using `[]`
notation, but it's always better to be safe than sorry.

> It is best practice to use `.hasOwnProperty()` in cases where you **ONLY**
> want to see if a property exists on the _Object_ itself and not down the
> prototype chain.

## delete

This function deletes the key (and its value) from an object. Example:

```jsx
const info = {
  ironman: 'arrogant',
  spiderman: 'naive',
  hulk: 'strong',
  thanos: 'powerful'
}
delete info.thanos
// after delete, info becomes:
//    {ironman: "arrogant", spiderman: "naive", hulk: "strong"}
```

Shouldn't it be `Object.delete(info)`?

Just when you were getting used to everything being a static function of the
Object type, we switched it up by introducing delete! delete is actually an
operator, and it can work on array elements and some variables, too—but in
practice, you'll mostly see it used on objects.

### Exercises:

1. Write a function called longestString that finds the longest value string in
   an object.

   ```jsx
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'
   }
   const result = longestString(info) // result should be "arrogant"
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('longestString function', () => {
     it('should find the longest string from the beginning of an object', () => {
       const info = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       expect(fn.longestString(info)).toEqual('arrogant')
     })
     it('should find the longest string from the end of an object', () => {
       const leaders = {
         vermilion: 'Surge',
         cinnabar: 'Blaine',
         fuchsia: 'Koga',
         saffron: 'Sabrina'
       }
       expect(fn.longestString(leaders)).toEqual('Sabrina')
     })
     it('should return the empty string for an empty object', () => {
       expect(fn.longestString({})).toEqual('')
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const longestString = obj => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an object `obj`.
   - Use array helper method `reduce` to go through each string value and find
     the longest string in the `obj`.
   - Starts with an empty string.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx

This was easy because we were just working with values, and could "throw away"
the object itself. The next one will require you to make use of the keys array
while still referring back to the entire object, and there are a couple of
different ways to do it. See if you can figure one out!

2. Write a function called keyOfLongestString that finds the longest value
   string but returns its key.

   ```jsx
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'
   }
   const result = keyOfLongestString(info) // result should be "ironman"
   // because "arrogant" is longer than "naive" and "strong"

   const info2 = {
     a: 'xxxxxx',
     bc: 'xx',
     abc: 'xxx'
   }
   const result2 = keyOfLongestString(info2) // result2 should be "a"
   // "xxxxxx" is longer than "xx" and "xxx"
   ```

   ```jsx
   describe('keyOfLongestString function', () => {
     it('should find key of longest string in the beginning of an object', () => {
       const info = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       expect(fn.keyOfLongestString(info)).toEqual('ironman')
     })
     it('should find key of longest string at the end of an object', () => {
       const leaders = {
         vermilion: 'Surge',
         cinnabar: 'Blaine',
         fuchsia: 'Koga',
         saffron: 'Sabrina'
       }
       expect(fn.keyOfLongestString(leaders)).toEqual('saffron')
     })
     it('should return undefined (no key) for an empty object', () => {
       expect(fn.keyOfLongestString({})).toEqual(undefined)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const keyOfLongestString = obj => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an object `obj`.
   - We need a local variable(let's call it `allKeys`) and it will store all the
     keys from the `obj`.
   - When the length of `allKeys` reaches 0, return undefined.
   - We need another local variable(let's call it `longestKey`. It finds the
     longest key by using array method `reduce` to compare the length of the
     values and return the key with the longest value.
     - It starts with the first element of `allKeys`.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const keyOfLongestString = obj => {
     const allKeys = Object.keys(obj)
     if (allKeys.length === 0) return undefined
     const longestKey = allKeys.reduce((lKey, key) => {
       if (obj[key].length > obj[lKey].length) {
         return key
       }
       return lKey
     }, allKeys[0])
     return longestKey
   }
   ```

By now whenever you see an array (or something that should be turned into an
array) and need to look at all elements and boil them down to one answer—whether
it’s a length; a sum; another array; or an answer like the longest, greatest, or
shortest, or smallest—you should be thinking of `reduce`. It’s quite a useful
function!

Like we said in the last debrief, there are several other ways you could have
written this function, such as reducing as `Object.entries(obj)`.

3. Use your `keyOfLongestString` function to write a function called
   removeLongestString.

   ```jsx
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'
   }
   removeLongestString(info)
   // info is changed to:
   // {spiderman: "naive", hulk: "strong"}

         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       fn.removeLongestString(info)
       expect(info).toEqual({ spiderman: 'naive', hulk: 'strong' })
     })
     it('should remove the longest string at the end of an object', () => {
       const leaders = {
         vermilion: 'Surge',
         cinnabar: 'Blaine',
         fuchsia: 'Koga',

       fn.removeLongestString(leaders)
       expect(leaders).toEqual({
         vermilion: 'Surge',
         cinnabar: 'Blaine',
         fuchsia: 'Koga'
       })
     })
     it('should work on an empty object', () => {
       const imEmpty = {}
       fn.removeLongestString(imEmpty)
       expect(imEmpty).toEqual({})
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const removeLongestString = obj => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an object `obj`.
   - We need an additional variable(let's call it `longestKey`). It stores the
     result of passing in the `obj` as an argument.
   - delete the object value when the `obj` is at key `longestKey`.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const removeLongestString = obj => {
     const longestKey = keyOfLongestString(obj)
     delete obj[longestKey]
   }
   ```

4. Write a function called commas that returns a string of all of an object's
   **values** separated by commas.

   ```jsx
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'
   }
   const result = commas(info)
   // result is 'arrogant, native, strong'
   ```

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('commas function', () => {
     it('should separate three items', () => {
       const info = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       expect(fn.commas(info)).toEqual('arrogant, naive, strong')
     })
     it('should put no commas if only one element', () => {
       expect(fn.commas(['funny'])).toEqual('funny')
     })
     it('should return an empty string if no elements', () => {
       expect(fn.commas([])).toEqual('')
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const commas = obj => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an object `obj`.
   - You need to get all the values of the `obj`. Attach `reduce` method to it.
   - Inside the `reduce` method,
     - create a local variable(let's say `firstComma`) which starts at empty
       string.
     - When index `i` reaches 0, firstComma equals empty string.
     - return `acc` + `firstComma` + `e` (In this case accumulator is `result`)
     - starts with an empty string
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const commas = obj => {
     return Object.values(obj).reduce((result = '', e, i) => {
       let firstComma = ', '
       if (i === 0) {
         firstComma = ''
       }
       return result + firstComma + e
     }, '')
   }

5. Write a function called headers that joins all of an object's **keys** inside
   `<h1>` tags.

   ```jsx
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const. headers = () => {

   }
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an object `obj`.
   - Get all the keys from the `obj` and attach `reduce` method to it.
   - Inside the `reduce` function,
     - return accumulator + `h1` tag wrapped around each element.
     - starts with an empty string
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const headers = obj => {
     return Object.keys(obj).reduce((result, e, i) => {

# Prototype Inheritance

Prototype functions are great for memory efficiency when you plan on
_constructing_ many Objects.

Want to add functions into every object that you create? Just assign them to
`Object.prototype`. To make this work, you must:

1. Define your function using `function( ... params ... ) { ... code ...}`

   > _It is important **NOT** to use an arrow-function `() => {}` here because
   > of how it treats `this` - You can read more on arrow-functions here
   > [MDN Arrow Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)_

2. Assign your function to `Object.prototype`
3. Access object properties using the `this` keyword

```jsx
Object.prototype.forEach = function (
  fun,
  i = 0,
  entries = Object.entries(this)
) {
  if (i === entries.length) return
  fun(entries[i][1], entries[i][0])
  return this.forEach(fun, i + 1)
}
```

You can also add new properties to `this` using prototype functions.

```jsx
Object.prototype.eat = function (value) {
  const num = this.data || 0
  if (value < num) {
    return
  }
  this.data = value
}

const a = { name: 'iron' }
a.eat(5)
// a is: { name: "iron", data: 5 }

a.eat(3)
// nothing happens because 3 is smaller than 5
// a is: { name: "iron", data: 5 }

a.eat(30)
// 30 is bigger than 5, so update data property
// a is: { name: "iron", data: 30 }
```

## The "_`new`" Keyword_

When you construct a _new_ Object with the `new` keyword, there are a few things
that are happening in the background for you. This involves how the `this` is
defined and used.

Let's look at an example to see what's happening.

```jsx
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
}

const me = new Person('Joe', 24)
```

The `Person` function is nothing special, it is just like any other function we
use in JavaScript. What makes it special is HOW we use it, and the `new`
keyword.

When I do something like `new Person()` JavaScript will handle constructing a
new Object for me and set up the Prototype Inheritance for me.

This is how the Person function is being used when we call it with `new`.

```jsx
function Person(name, age) {
  // this part is done for us implicitly "behind the scenes"
  const this = Object.create(Person.prototype)

  this.name = name
  this.age = age

  // this part is done for us
  return this
}
```

With the above code, I could use the _Person_ function the same way as before
**WITHOUT** the `new` keyword and construct a new Object just by calling
`Person()`. Of course, why do the extra work when we can let JavaScript handle
it for us by using the `new` keyword?

The main takeaway from this is what's happening behind-the-scenes and also, what
_Object.create()_ does for us. _Object.create_ is how inheritance is set up in
JavaScript, it allows you to create the "prototype chain" for a new Object. You
can read more about it here
[MDN Object.create](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create).

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js3/objectCreate.png"
  height="500"
  width="318"
/>

This is a view of the JavaScript console on the Chrome browser. The `>` is where
code was input into the console and the `<-` is the output from the code that
preceded.

1. Set up the `Person` function to use as an Object constructor.
2. Define a `myName` function on the _prototype_ property of _Person_.
   _(**prototype** is a property that exists on functions already, see Note
   below_)
3. Construct a _new instance_ of Person and assign it to the `j` variable.
4. Check to see what `j` contains. _(from the code output you can see it is a
   Person object)_
5. The next line is to show that objects **DO NOT** have the _prototype_
   property on them. It is only the constructor functions.
6. We then check the \***\*proto\*\*** property on the object `j` which will
   show us the prototype chain _(\***\*proto\*\*** is deprecated and
   `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` should be used instead, see Note below)_

Below is a note from the MDN page which talks all about prototypes in
JavaScript.
[MDN JS Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes):

**_Note_**: _It's important to understand that there is a distinction between an
object's prototype (available via Object.getPrototypeOf(obj), or via the
deprecated_ **_proto_** _property) and the prototype property on constructor
functions._

_The constructor function Foobar() has its own prototype, which can be found by
calling Object.getPrototypeOf(Foobar). However this differs from its prototype
property, Foobar.prototype, which is the blueprint for instances of this
constructor function._

_If we were to create a new instance — let fooInstance = new Foobar() —
fooInstance would take its prototype from its constructor function's prototype
property. Thus Object.getPrototypeOf(fooInstance) === Foobar.prototype._

## Exercises

Time to be creative and write some prototype functions!

1. Write a forEach function for objects.

   ```jsx
   const info = {
     ironman: 'arrogant',
     spiderman: 'naive',
     hulk: 'strong'
   }
   const result = info.forEach((key, value, i) => {
     console.log(key, value, i)
   })
   // Will print out the following:
   /*
   ironman arrogant 0
   spiderman naive 1
   hulk strong 2
   */

   // No need to set module.exports because there is nothing to export
   ```

         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'

       info.forEach(fun)
       expect(fun).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3)

     it('should run a function 0 times on an empty object', () => {
       const fun = jest.fn()
       const imEmpty = {}
       imEmpty.forEach(fun)
       expect(fun).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
     })
     it('should let functions access object values & positions', () => {
       const vals = []
       const fun = (_k, v, i) => {
         vals.push(i + v)

       const info = {
         ironman: 'arrogant',
         spiderman: 'naive',
         hulk: 'strong'
       }
       info.forEach(fun)
       expect(vals).toEqual(['0arrogant', '1naive', '2strong'])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   Object.prototype.forEach = function (cb) {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given a callback function `cb`.
   - We need an additional variable(let's call it `i`) to keep track of index
     which starts at 0.
   - We need another additional variable(let's call it `keys`) to get all the
     keys of the object given `this`.
   - When `i` reaches the length of `keys`, return.
   - Call the callback function.
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   Object.prototype.forEach = function (cb, i = 0, keys = Object.keys(this)) {
     if (i === keys.length) return
     cb(keys[i], this[keys[i]], i, this)
     return this.forEach(cb, i + 1, keys)
   }
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">
    We solved this function using recursion. But you could also have done it by calling the array `forEach` function on `Object.entries(this)`. After all, `forEach` is already implemented for arrays, and the `entries` array could help us extend this functionality to objects.

   console.log(result) // should print out:

       const result = leaders.filter(celadon)
       expect(result).toEqual({})
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   Object, (prototype.filter = function (cb) {})
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We are given a callback function `cb`.
   - We need an additional variable(let's call it `result`) and it starts with
     an empty object.
   - We need an additional variable(let's call it `i`) to track index and it
     starts at 0.
   - We need another additional variable(let's call it `keys`) to get all the
     keys of the object given `this`.
   - When `i` reaches the length of `keys`, return `result`.
   - We need a local variable(let's call it `currentKey`) and it starts with
     first index of `keys`.
   - We need a local variable(let's call it `element`) and it stores the result
     of calling the callback function.
   - When `element` is true, `result` at key `currentKEy` is equal to `this` at
     key `currentKey`.

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   Object.prototype.reduce = function (cb) {}

3. **Explanation**
   - We are given a callback function `cb`.
   - We are given an accumulator `acc`.

   - We need another additional variable(let's call it `keys`) to get all the

You’ve now gotten some insight into how three of the array helper functions work
by implementing them for objects. They’re pretty simple once you get the hang of
them! All our solutions used recursion, and some sort of result or accumulator
variable to keep track of what the function is doing. The main decision was how
to iterate through the object; keys don’t work like indices where we could say
`obj[0]`, `obj[1]`, etc.

For all our solutions we chose to pull out the keys into an array, then iterate
through the keys, using the keys to pull their corresponding values from the
object (key = `keys[i]`, value = `this[keys[i]]`). We could have also pulled the
values separately using something like `values = Object.values(this)` and
`values[i]` to get each value. We could have even used `Object.entries(this)`
and then `entries[i][0]` for the keys and `entries[i][1]` for the values.

     l: 1,
     o: 1,
     i: 1,
     z: 1
   }
   */
   ```

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('getCharCount function', () => {
     it('should count letters in an array of 3 strings', () => {
       const result = ['Charmander', 'Charmeleon', 'Charizard'].getCharCount()
       expect(result).toEqual({

     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.getCharCount = function () {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a helper function(let's call it `addChar`)
   - `addChar` takes in three parameters: `map` which starts with an empty
     object, string `str`, and an index `i` which starts at 0.
     - When `i` reaches the length of `str`, return map.
     - We need a local variable(let's call it `letter`) which stores the `str`
       at index `i`.
     - The value of `map` is equal to the value of `map` or 0.
     - The value of `map` is equal to the value of `map` plus 1.
     - Continue
     - Attach `reduce` method to `this`.
       - return by calling the `addChar` function.
       - It starts with an empty object.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.getCharCount = function () {
     const addChar = (map = {}, str, i = 0) => {
       if (i === str.length) {
         return map
       }
       const letter = str[i]
       map[letter] = map[letter] || 0
       map[letter] = map[letter] + 1
       return addChar(map, str, i + 1)
     }
     return this.reduce((acc, e) => {
       return addChar(acc, e)
     }, {})
   }
   ```

You might have seen an array and noticed an opportunity to use `reduce`. Great!
Another simple way to solve this problem would have been to use two levels of
recursion, like in zeroSquare—for example an `i` counter for the strings and a
`j` counter for the letters. You also probably noticed that whether you used
recursion or `reduce`, you would need an accumulator, starting as an empty
object `{}`, to store the results.

5. Write a `getMostCommon` prototype function for arrays that returns the most
   common element.

```jsx
;[9, 8, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7].getMostCommon()[
  // returns 7 because it is the most common element

  ('Batman', 8, 7, 'Batman', 'Robin')
].getMostCommon()
// returns "Batman" because it is the most common element
```

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

Start by counting the frequency of each unique element in the array (you can
make a new array to hold these frequencies). Then use `reduce` on the
frequencies to find out which is the highest. Because object keys are always
strings, you won't be able to use the elements themselves as keys; doing so
would give `"7"` as the most common element of the first example above instead
of `7`. But you can make a little object to store an element along with its
frequency, then store these little objects in an array.

   describe('getMostCommon function', () => {
     it('should return a number as the most common', () => {
       const result = [9, 8, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7].getMostCommon()
       expect(result).toEqual(7)
     })
     it('should return a string as the most common', () => {
       const arr = ['Batman', 8, 7, 'Batman', 'Robin']
       const result = arr.getMostCommon()
       expect(result).toEqual('Batman')
     })
     it('should return first element if all equally common', () => {
       const types = ['grass', 'poison', 'fire', 'flying', 'water', 'bug']
       const result = types.getMostCommon()
       expect(result).toEqual('grass')
     })
     it('should return null on an empty array', () => {
       const result = [].getMostCommon()
       expect(result).toEqual(null)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.getMostCommon = function () {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   **Steps for Solution 1:**

   - We need a local variable(let's call it `mapOfElments`) which stores the
     `reduce` method attached to `this`.
   - Inside the `reduce` method, build the object with the given array.
   - We need another local variable(let's call it `mostCommon`) which stores:
     - Attach `Object.entries` method to `mapOfElements`.
     - Attach `reduce` method to the the result of the step above.
   - Inside the `reduce` method.
     - We need a local variable(let's call it `element`) which equals first
       element of the array.
     - We need another local variable(let's call it `count`) which equals the
       second element of the array.
     - When `count` is less than the accumulator at index 1, return the element.
     - return the accumulator
     - It starts with an array `[undefined, 0]`.
   - return `mostCommon` at index 0.

   **Steps for Solution 2:**

   - We need a local variable (let's call it `arrMapCommon`) which stores the
     result of attaching `reduce` method to the given array.
   - Inside the `reduce` method,
     - We need a local variable(let's call it `map`) and it is equal to the
       first element of the starting array.
     - Build the object in terms of how many times each elements exist.
     - We need a local variable(let's call it `count`) and it is equal to the
       third element of the starting array.
       - When the value of `map` at given element is greater than `count`,
         - set the last element of starting array to the value of `map` at that
           key element.
         - set the second element of starting array to the element you pass in
           the `reduce` method.
         - return the accumulator
     - return the element's value of `arrMapCommon` at second element.

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.getMostCommon = function () {
     const mapOfElements = this.reduce((acc, e) => {
       acc[e] = acc[e] || 0
       acc[e] = acc[e] + 1
       return acc
     }, {})

     const mostCommon = Object.entries(mapOfElements).reduce(
       (acc, e) => {
         const element = e[0]
         const count = e[1]
         if (count > acc[1]) {
           if (parseInt(element)) {
             return [parseInt(element), count]
           }
           return e
         }
         return acc
       },
       [null, 0]
     )

     return mostCommon[0]
   }

   // SOLUTION 2 -> Customize starting value of reduce
   Array.prototype.getMostCommon = function () {
     const arrMapCommon = this.reduce(
       (acc, e) => {
         const map = acc[0]
         map[e] = map[e] || 0
         map[e] = map[e] + 1

         const count = acc[2]
         if (map[e] > count) {
           acc[2] = map[e]
           acc[1] = e
         }
         return acc
       },
       [{}, null, 0]
     )

     return arrMapCommon[1]
   }
   ```

This function has two parts: First we have to count the frequency of each item
in the array. Then we have to find the item with the highest frequency. To count
the frequency, we can use a very similar `reduce` call to the one in problem 4.
Then we have to go back through the returned object and find which key occurs
the most. For that, we can use the function that we wrote for Object Helpers,
exercise 1 (longestString) with some silght modifications.

You’ll notice that an alternative solution is to let the one reduce call do all
the work for us. In the first solution, we sort of tricked `reduce` into passing
along 2 accumulator arguments, and in this one we're making it pass along all 3
things: all the frequencies as well the current most common element and its
frequency. Even though reduce technically only takes one accumulator, we can get
away with this by wrapping the 3 pieces of information we need in an array!

6. Write a `removeDupes` prototype function for arrays that removes duplicate
   elements from the array.

       data.removeDupes()
       expect(data).toEqual([9])
     })
     it('should remove 1 set of duplicate strings', () => {
       const data = ['ice', 'electric', 'psychic', 'ice', 'ground', 'ice']
       data.removeDupes()
       expect(data).toEqual(['electric', 'psychic', 'ground'])
     })
     it('should remove duplicate boolean values', () => {
       const data = ['grass', false, 'poison', 'electric', false]
       data.removeDupes()
       expect(data).toEqual(['grass', 'poison', 'electric'])

     it("shouldn't remove anything from an array with no dups", () => {
       const data = ['Pewter', 'Saffron', 'Vermilion', 'Veridian']

     it('should leave an empty array unchanged', () => {
       const data = []
       data.removeDupes()
       expect(data).toEqual([])
     })
   })

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   //Main Function
   Array.prototype.removeDupes = function () {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - First we need to get an object of how many times each element shows up in
     the array.
   - We need a function to remove all the count that does not equal 1:
     - We need an additional variable(let's call it `i`) to keep track of index
       and it starts at 0.
     - When `i` is at the the length of given array, we are done so return
     - If the element shows up exactly 1 time, then we continue to next i
     - Otherwise, remove the element at index `i`, and run the function again
       without increasing `i`
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   //Main Function
   Array.prototype.removeDupes = function () {
     const map = this.reduce((acc, e) => {
       acc[e] = (acc[e] || 0) + 1
       return acc
     }, {})

     const remove = (i = 0) => {
       if (i === this.length) {
         return
       }
       if (map[this[i]] === 1) {
         return remove(i + 1)
       }
       this.splice(i, 1)
       return remove(i)
     }
     remove()
   }
   ```

**Examples:** We've seen a couple examples of how this function should work.
Note that it removes not just extra elements, but _all_ copies of an element
that occurs more than once.

**Function shape:** This is a prototype function, so the array we’re working on
will be `this`. Since it modifies the array in place, it has no return value and
takes no arguments.

```jsx
Array.prototype.removeDupes = function () {}
```

**Think:** We'll need some code that counts how many times each element occurs
in an array, then some code to remove all occurences of a given value from an
array. We haven't done this exactly, but you might remember `removeEvens` from
JS 2; we can use code similar to this. That function was recursive, but we
probably shouldn't make this entire function recursive—we don't need to count
the occurences multiple times!

So let's write a **helper function** _inside_ `Array.prototype.removeDupes` to
recursively remove the duplicate values once we've counted them. We can call it
`removeDupes` without a name collision because it won't be attached to the array
prototype. This will return nothing since it also modifies the array in place,
and it will need only one parameter, an iterator or counter.

```jsx
const removeDupes = (i = 0) => {}
```

Notice how we made this a Fat Arrow function—that way we can still use `this` to
access the array we're working on! (Our little helper function won't get its own
`this` that would override it.)

**Code:** The rest is quick because we've already written everything we need in
other exercises—now we just have to put it together. There are several other
ways we could have done this, such as using `reduce` to make an array of only
values that occur more than once, then using `forEach` to remove each one from
the original array.

**Test:** Testing your code should cover as many _types_ of input as possible.
Let's start with the examples and see if we can think of some more:

```jsx
[9,8,7,8,7,7,7] // items occur 1, 2, and 3 times
["Batman", 8,7, "Batman", "Robin"] // one item occurs twice
["Spearow", "Fearow", "Ekans", "Arbok"] // no duplicates
["I am groot", "I am groot", "I am groot"] // all the same; should become []
[] // it's always good to test empty arrays
```

# Arrays as Objects

In reality, an array is actually an object, with special status (you can use
numbers as keys, etc). You can add keys and values to arrays! The following
examples are for teaching purposes only—treating arrays as objects is not a good
idea, as it will confuse other engineers on your team.

```jsx
const a = [9, 8, 7, 5]
a.name = 'Tony Stark' // You assign a key and value to an array like an object
console.log(a) // will print out [ 9, 8, 7, 5, name: 'Tony Stark' ]
```

Here's a `countForEach` function that keeps a counter of how many times it's
called:

```jsx
// This creates a new array function, countForEach
// This function calls the normal forEach function and returns
//    how many times the function has been called on the array
Array.prototype.countForEach = function (cb) {
  // The first time this function is called, this.forEachCount will be undefined
  //     When that happens, we use 0
  this.forEachCount = (this.forEachCount || 0) + 1

  // Calls the regular forEach function in the array
  this.forEach(cb)

  return this.forEachCount
}
const villains = ['Joker', 'Catwoman', 'Penguin', 'Riddler']
villains.countForEach(() => {}) // returns 1
villains.countForEach(() => {}) // returns 2
villains.countForEach(() => {}) // returns 3

const moreVillains = ['Two-Face', 'Bane']
moreVillains.countForEach(() => {}) + villains.countForEach(() => {})
// Returns 1 + 4, which is 5
```

Notice how we gave the array a _property_, `forEachCount`, as if were an object.

## Exercises

1. Write a `getNext` prototype function for arrays that returns the next element
   of the array.

   ```jsx
   const a = ["Edna", "Optimus", "Minion"]
   a.getNext() // returns "Edna"
   a.getNext() // returns "Optimus"
   a.getNext() // returns "Minion"

   a.getNext() // returns "Edna"

   - Create a constant index variable that is assigned to `this.indexCounter`
     or 0.
   - Assign `this.indexCounter` to the currentIndex + 1 and modulo that result
     by this.length
   - Return the current index of `this` array.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.getNext = function () {
     const index = this.indexCounter || 0
     this.indexCounter = (index + 1) % this.length
     return this[index]
   }
   ```

Look familiar? This is very similar to `Array.prototype.getIterator` from JS 2.
How is it different? Here, we’re not returning a function, so we need our
iterator/counter variable to be defined _outside_ of this function.
`Array.prototype.getNext(i=0)` is no good because every time we run it, `i` will
go back to 0 and we'll just have a lot of "Edna". But now that we know how to
put named keys in arrays, we can define a counter outside the function just by
setting `this.indexCounter`.

Because it's part of the Array _prototype_, it's not part of the array itself,
and won't show up if you console.log the array! But just like every array can
access prototype functions like `map` and `pop`, your array will now be able to
access its `indexCounter`.

2. Write an Array `setMaxSize` prototype function that gives arrays a max length
   beyond which new elements can no longer be pushed.

   ```jsx
   const a = ['Edna', 'Optimus', 'Minion']
   a.setMaxSize(4)

   a.push('Groot') // push returns 4.
   // Array is ["Edna", "Optimus", "Minion", "Groot"]

   a.push('hello') // Nothing happens. push returns 4, array stays the same.
   ```

Did you know that you can override existing prototype functions? It's as easy as
assigning a new value to a key inside of the setMaxSize object. Just make sure
to save the old one into a variable first so you can keep using its
functionality.

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('setMaxSize prototype', () => {
     it('maxSize should stay four', () => {
       const arr = ['Michelangelo', 'Leonardo', 'Raphael']
       arr.setMaxSize(4)
       arr.push('Donatello')
       arr.setMaxSize(3)
       arr.push('Shredder')
       arr.setMaxSize(1)
       arr.push('Splinter')
       expect(arr.length).toEqual(4)
     })
     it('maxSize should increase', () => {
       const arr = ['Michelangelo']
       arr.setMaxSize(2)
       arr.push('Donatello')
       expect(arr.length).toEqual(2)
     })
     it('maxSize keeps array empty', () => {
       const arr = []
       arr.setMaxSize(0)
       arr.push('M', 'L', 'R')
       expect(arr.length).toEqual(0)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.setMaxSize = function (max) {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - Create `Array.prototype.setMaxSize` that passes in a max variable.
   - Inside setMaxSize prototype save `this.push` in a variable called
     `this.oldPush`.
   - Inside setMaxSize prototype assign `this.push` to an arrow function that
     passes in a new element.
   - if your max parameter is greather than `this.length` return this.oldPush
     envoked with your new element parameter.
   - else return `this.length`
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.setMaxSize = function (size) {
     this.oldPush = this.push
     this.push = newElement => {
       if (this.length < size) {
         return this.oldPush(newElement)
       }
       return this.length
     }
   }
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

Why doesn't `Array.prototype.push` work?:

```jsx
Array.prototype.setMaxSize = function(max) {
  this.max = max
  this.oldPush = this.push
}

Array.prototype.push = function(newElement) {
  if (this.length < this.max) {
    return this.oldPush(newElement)
    }
    return this.length
  }
}
```

The problem is that you're setting `Array.prototype.push` to some function that
you defined.

Then you're calling `Array.prototype.setMaxSize`, which sets `this.oldPush` to
your own defined `Array.prototype.push` (not the original
`Array.prototype.push`).

So `this.oldPush` and `Array.prototype.push` are both the same function which is
the function you defined.

So your defined Array.prototype.push function will call `this.oldPush` which is
also your defined `Array.prototype.push` function, so it just keeps calling
itself forever.

**This is an example of why it is considered bad practice to overwrite _built-in_
Javascript prototypes and methods.**

3. Write a `tiredForEach` prototype function that runs a function on each
   element of an array, but makes the user wait a specified amount of time
   before calling it again.

   ```jsx
   const a = ['chinese', 'african', 'korean']
   const callback = (e, i) => {
     console.log(e + i)
   }
   a.tiredForEach(callback, 180)
   /* 
   prints out:
   chinese0
   african1
   korean2
   */

   a.tiredForEach(callback, 180)
   /* 
   prints out:
   "Too tired. Please wait 180ms.
   */

   setTimeout(() => {
     // run tiredForEach after 190ms
     a.tiredForEach(callback, 180)
   }, 190)

   /* 
   ... 190ms later....
   prints out:
   chinese0
   african1
   korean2
   */
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. Tests

   ```jsx
   describe('tiredForEach function', () => {
     jest.useFakeTimers()
     it('should call callback immediately when not tired', () => {
       const callback = jest.fn()
       const arr = ['Edna', 'Optimus', 'Minion']
       arr.tiredForEach(callback, 200)
       expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled()
     })
     it('should not run function before time has passed', () => {
       const callback = jest.fn()
       const callback2 = jest.fn()
       const arr = ['Edna', 'Optimus', 'Minion']
       arr.tiredForEach(callback, 200)
       arr.tiredForEach(callback2, 200)
       expect(callback2).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
     })
     it('should work again once time has passed', () => {
       const callback = jest.fn()
       const arr = ['Edna', 'Optimus', 'Minion']
       arr.tiredForEach(callback, 200)
       jest.advanceTimersByTime(200)
       arr.tiredForEach(callback, 200)
       expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(6)
     })
   })
   ```

2. Shape

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.tiredForEach = function (cb, time) {
     return // ...
   }
   ```

3. Explanation
   - Create an array prototype called tiredForEach that takes in a callback and
     time.
   - Check whether `this.isTired` is true,
     - If it is return a console.log() with the "too tired" text. Return stops
       the function
   - Assign `this.isTired` to true and `this.waiTime` to time.
   - Call a SetTimeout with an arrow function and time as parameters.
     - Inside the arrow function assign `this.isTired` to false.
   - e. return `this.forEach(cb)`.
4. Code

   ```jsx
   Array.prototype.tiredForEach = function (cb, time) {
     if (this.isTired)
       return console.log(`Too tired. Please wait ${this.waitTime}ms.`)

     this.isTired = true
     this.waitTime = time
     /*
   NOTE: The argument function to setTimeout is written 
       with () => {....}.
       If you write it using
       setTimeout(function {
          this.isTired
          ....
       then the code will not work. 
       Explanation provided in the next section.
   */
     setTimeout(() => {
       this.isTired = false
     }, time)
     return this.forEach(cb)
   }
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

We haven't covered telling what time it is per se, but we knew we would be
storing some information as a property of the array, and we remembered how to
make a function run after a certain amount of time using `setTimeout`. So we
made a _flag_ to be turned on when `tiredForEach` is called and turned off after
the requested wait time.

Remember that when using an `if` check, if a variable is undefined it’ll just
evaluate as falsey so it’s OK to say `if (this.tired)` even if `this.tired` has
not been defined yet.
