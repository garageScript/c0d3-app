# Function vs. Fat Arrow

So far, you've learned two ways to write a function:

- `(...) => {...}` (the "fat arrow" method): Taught in JS0
- `function(...) {...}` First introduced in this chapter for writing prototype
  functions

What is the difference between the two function declarations?

`function() {....}` vs `() => {....}` ?

## Explanation

The difference has to do with the `this` keyword.

### Before the fat arrow

A long time ago, there were no fat arrow functions. You had to write functions
like this:

```jsx
const fun = function(a,b) {
	...
}
```

### What is _this_?

```jsx
;[5, 2, 3].push(10)
// Inside the function `push`, **this** refers to whatever
// comes before the `.` ([5,2,3]) in this case.

const a = [9, 8, 7]
a.getLast()
// inside the function `getLast`, **this** refers to
// whatever comes before the `.` (a) in this case.

alert('Hi there')
// What about functions without `.`?
// What would **this** be in the function `alert`?
// Answer:
// If there is no `.`,
//   the browser will automatically put `window` when it runs your code:
//       window.alert("hello")
//       Therefore, inside the alert function, **this** refers to the window object
//   In nodejs, nodejs will automatically put `global` when it runs your code:
//       global.alert("hello")
//       Therefore, inside the alert function, **this** refers to the global object
```

What about the following example?

```jsx
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(this) // What is this? Answer below
})
```

In functions like `setTimeout` that were written by someone else, you can't
always know what `this` is, because `setTimeout` could be doing something like
the following:

```jsx
const setTimeout = function (fun) {
  const newObject = {}
  newObject.fun = fun // now newObject has the input function
  newObject.fun()
  // in the function passed into `setTimeout`,
  //     `this` refers to newObject
}
```

This makes many prototype functions really difficult to write because `this`
will never refer to the object or array.

```jsx
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
Array.prototype.delayedLast = function () {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(this[this.length - 1])
  }, 1000)
}
arr.delayedLast() // after 1000ms,
// The browser not print out what we expect,
// because `this` does not refer to the array [1,2,3].
```

The solution is to use a variable to store the value of `this` before anything
else can change it, then use that variable in the argument function passed into
`setTimeout`.

```jsx
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
Array.prototype.delayedLast = function () {
  const self = this
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(self[self.length - 1])
  }, 1000)
}
arr.delayedLast() // after 1000ms,
// The browser will print out 3. It works!
```

<Spoiler name = "Pop Quiz!">

What happens when we run this code?

```jsx
function Person(age) {
  this.age = age
}
Person.complain = function () {
  if (this.age >= 100)
    return "I'm getting way too old for these JavaScript exercises"

  return "I'm not old enough"
}

const yoda = new Person(419)
console.log(yoda.complain())
```

<Spoiler>

Throws an error (undefined in not a function) because the complain function is
on `Person`, not `Person.prototype`.

When we try to access `yoda.complain` , there's no property on the `yoda` object
called complain `complain` property, so it checks Person.prototype's prototype
which is `Object.prototype` and there's no `complain` property on
`Object.prototype` and there are no more prototypes to follow in the prototype
chain so `yoda.complain` is `undefined` and we can't call `undefined` like it's
a function so we get a runtime error.

We could still technically call the complain function like this to pass in
`yoda` as the `this` argument: `Person.complain.call(yoda)` , but that would be
akward. The better way to fix this is to add `complain` to `Person.prototype`
like `Person.prototype.complain = function() {}`.

</Spoiler>

What happens when we run this code?

```jsx
function Person(age) {
  this.age = age
}
Person.prototype.complain = () => {
  if (this.age >= 100)
    return "I'm getting way too old for these JavaScript exercises"

  return "I'm not old enough"
}

const yoda = new Person(419)
console.log(yoda.complain())
```

<Spoiler>

Silent logic error. When we define Person.prototype.complain, we set it as an
arrow function. Arrow functions bind the current `this` value in scope to that
arrow function so it's functionally similar to defining a function and binding
it, so this `() => { ... }` is functionally equivalent to this
`(function() { ... }).bind(this)`.

Using an arrow function and binding the `this` value is a problem because later
when we try to pass in `yoda` as the `this` argument by passing `yoda` to the
left of the dot in `yoda.complain()`, the `this` value passed in will be the
value that was bound when the function was defined. Since we're in the global
scope, the `this` value is `window` or `global`.

So we'll get a silent logic error because we'll check this.age, which is
window.age or global.age which is undefined (unless there's a global variable
with the name age) and undefined >= 100 is false. So the complain function will
always return "I'm not old enough" even if the person is really old. The way to
fix this is by defining Person.prototype.complain as an unbound non-arrow
function like this: `Person.prototype.complain = function()`.

</Spoiler>

**The Fat Arrow** `() => {}` was designed to solve the above! Using a fat arrow
function, you can write functions that use `this` to refer to the affected
object without creating a new variable.

```jsx
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
Array.prototype.delayedLast = function () {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(this[this.length - 1])
  }, 1000)
}
arr.delayedLast() // After 1000ms,
// the browser will print out 3. It works!
```

<Spoiler name="On semicolons. Some developers always use it, some don't. Choice is yours.">

Some JavaScript engineers would tell their engineers to always use semicolons at
the end of each statement. Otherwise, the code may all get mixed together. If we
rewrite the above example with the following code, it will not run

```jsx
Array.prototype.delayedLast = function () {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(this[this.length - 1])
  }, 1000)
}[(1, 2, 3)].delayedLast()
```

This is because the computer reads the code like this:
`...}[1,3,3].delayedLast()`, which means something else (The author himself
doesn't know what it means, so this level of detail is probably not important to
learn right now).

The solution is to put `;` between the previous code and the array to separate
it.

```jsx
Array.prototype.delayedLast = function () {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(this[this.length - 1])
  }, 1000)
}
;[1, 2, 3].delayedLast()
```

</Spoiler>

The Fat Arrow is a lighter way to write functions because unlike the old way of
writing `function`, fat arrow functions do not create a `this` variable. Looking
at the `setTimeout` code above:

```jsx
...
  setTimeout( () => {
    console.log(this[this.length-1])
  }, 1000)
...
```

The function argument that we pass into `setTimeout` is a fat arrow function and
therefore does not have its own `this` variable. As a result, when the argument
function runs, `this` simply refers to the `this` value in the outer function,
which is the object.

# Import / Export

Imagine you have created a bunch of awesome functions that you want to use in
other files. To do this, you simply give the `exports` key of the `module`
object a value. Whatever value you set will be exported. `module.exports` is a
keyword provided by nodeJS. You've seen it used to export solution files to a
test file.

```jsx
module.exports = [1, 2, 3] // What is module.exports?
// What type of data is module?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
module.exports = [1, 2, 3] // module.exports is an array: [1,2,3]
// module is obviously an object because it has a key called exports.
```

</Spoiler>

## Examples

1. Export: Any file that exports something can be called a **library**. Here
   we'll create two simple libraries.

   1. Create a file called `helper1.js` and write in the code below.

      `./helper1.js` - exports an object with 2 keys: `data` (object) and
      `getData` (function)

      ```jsx
      const info = {
        ironman: 'arrogant',
        spiderman: 'naive',
        hulk: 'strong'
      }

      module.exports = {
        data: info,
        getData: key => {
          return info[key]
        }
      }
      ```

   2. Create a file called `helper2.js` and write in the code below.

      `./helper2.js` - exports an array

      ```jsx
      module.exports = ['ironman', 'strange', 'thor', 'spiderman', 'hulk']
      ```

2. Import: We will create a file that imports the libraries created in the steps
   above.

   1. Create a file called `solution.js` and write in the code below.

      `./solution.js` - node will be running this file. `helper1.js` and
      `helper2.js` are files from the section above.

      ```jsx
      // myObj takes the value of module.exports, which is an object
      const myObj = require('./helper1.js')

      // myArr takes the value of module.exports, which is an array
      const myArr = require('./helper2.js')

      const result = myArr.filter(e => {
        return myObj.getData(e)
      }) // what is result?

      console.log(result)
      ```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
// myObj takes the value of module.exports, which is an object
const myObj = require('./helper1.js')

// myArr is ["ironman", "strange", "thor", "spiderman", "hulk"]
const myArr = require('./helper2.js')

const result = myArr.filter(e => {
  return myObj.getData(e)
})
// result is ["ironman", "spiderman", "hulk"]
/*
When filter runs....

e is "ironman", myObj.getData("ironman") returns "arrogant" (truthy)
e is "strange", myObj.getData("strange") returns undefined (falsey)
e is "thor", myObj.getData("thor") returns undefined (falsey)
e is "spiderman", myObj.getData("spiderman") returns "naive" (truthy)
e is "hulk", myObj.getData("hulk") returns "strong" (truthy)

filter returns ["ironman", "spiderman", "hulk"]
*/
```

</Spoiler>

## Exercises

1. Create 2 files, `./myObj.js`, `./myFun.js`, that export an object and a
   function respectively.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
// myObj.js
module.exports = {
  name: 'Butterfree',
  level: 11
}

// myFun.js
module.exports = () => {
  return 500
}
```

</Spoiler>

2. Create 1 file that imports the files created above and does something with
   the imported object and function. Make sure to `console.log` your output to
   make sure your functions are called correctly.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
// new file (any name, same folder as myObj.js and myFun.js)
const pokemon = require('./myObj')
const fun = require('./myFun')

const sum = fun() + pokemon.level
console.log(sum)
```

# Libraries

Now that you know how to use `require`, let's try to require a library that
other people have written. A simple library that does not require any download
is `fs`, a library that gives you functions to interact with the files and
folders on your computer.

```jsx
const fs = require('fs')
fs.readdir('./', (err, files) => {
  console.log(files) // files should be an array
})
```

**Exercise:** Edit the code so you only console.log filenames with length < 10.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fs = require('fs')
fs.readdir('./', (err, files) => {
  files.forEach(fileName => {
    if (fileName.length < 10) {
      console.log(fileName)
    }
  })
})
```

</Spoiler>

`fs.readdir` takes in 2 arguments, a string and a function.

Why do you need to pass in a function?

Just like how it takes you time to read a book, `fs.readdir` needs time to look
through the entire folder. When it is done looking through the folder, it will
run your function and pass in 2 arguments: error (if there are issues, null
otherwise), and an array of filenames in the folder.

```jsx
fs.readdir('./', (err, files) => {
  console.log('a')
})
console.log('b')
// What gets printed out?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
// "b"
// "a"
// This is because it takes time for fs.readddir to read the folder.
```

</Spoiler>

### Practical Applications

Now that you know how to import files, you should try to import some functions
that other people have written!

1. Write a function called makeFiles that takes in a number (X) and creates X+1
   files using `fs.writeFile`.

   - The filenames should look like: `trainer0.txt`, `trainer1.txt`,
     `trainer2.txt`, ... `trainerX.txt`.
   - When you open the file, each file should have the contents:
     `Gotta catch 'em all`
   - `fs.writeFile` takes in 3 arguments:

     - string (filename)
     - string (file content)
     - function (to run when the function has finished creating the file; in
       case you want to check for errors or inform the user that the write
       succeeded)

     Here's an example of how `fs.writeFile` works:

     ```jsx
     fs.writeFile('./today.txt', 'today is a beautiful day', () => {})
     // This will create a file called today.txt in the same folder
     //     When you open the file, it will say 'today is a beautiful day'
     ```

<Spoiler name = "Tests">

```jsx
const fs = require('fs')

describe('makeFiles function', () => {
  fn.makeFiles(2)
  const files = fs.readdirSync('./')
  it('should create 3 files', () => {
    const foundAll =
      files.find(e => {
        return e === 'trainer0.txt'
      }) &&
      files.find(e => {
        return e === 'trainer1.txt'
      }) &&
      files.find(e => {
        return e === 'trainer2.txt'
      })
    expect(foundAll).toBeTruthy()
  })
  it('should put "Gotta catch \'em all" in the files', async () => {
    await fs.readFile('./trainer1.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' }, (_err, data) => {
      expect(data).toEqual("Gotta catch 'em all")
    })
  })
})
```

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fs = require('fs')
const makeFiles = (n, i = 0) => {
  if (i > n) {
    return
  }
  fs.writeFile(`./trainer${i}.txt`, "Gotta catch 'em all", () => {})
  return makeFiles(n, i + 1)
}
```

</Spoiler>

2. Write a function called listFiles that reads the current folder and creates a
   file called `files.html` that looks like the following:

   ```jsx
   <h1>file1</h1><h1>file2</h1>...<h1>fileX</h1>
   ```

   We won't be able to test this one since we don't know all the files in your
   folder.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fs = require('fs')
const listFiles = () => {
  fs.readdir('./', (err, files) => {
    const str = files.reduce((acc, f) => {
      return `${acc}<h1>${f}</h1>`
    }, '')
    fs.writeFile('./files.html', str, () => {})
  })
}
```

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

You might have tried putting all the `<h1>`s into an array and then writing it.
Unfortunately, `fs.writeFile` writes arrays with commas separating the elements,
so reduce is a better choice here.

# APIs

An **API** (application programming interface) is an interface that other
engineers set up for you to interact with. For example:

- When you send a request to Netflix's API, you get a list of movies in
  Netflix's catalog, top-rated movies on Netflix, etc.
- When you send a request to the Google Contacts API, you get a list of your
  contacts or your friend's phone number.
- When you send a request to Twilio's API with a string and people's phone
  numbers, it will help you send the string as a text message to each of the
  phone numbers.

... and many, many more.

What is an example of something you can build with the APIs mentioned above?

You can write a file that sends a text message to each of your friends every
week with the top-rated movies on Netflix!

```jsx
// This code does not work.
// It is meant to give you an idea of what the code
//    would look like.
// Take the time to read and understand the code.
const request = require('request')

const txtTopRatedMoviesTo = people => {
  request('netflix.com/api/topCatalog', movies => {
    people.forEach(number => {
      // A Twilio token is needed so twilio knows it's me
      //    and charges me for every message I send
      request('twilio.com/api/sendMessage', { token: twilio_token, to: number })
    })
  })
}

const runApp = () => {
  // A Google token is needed so Google knows it's me
  request('google.com/contacts', { token: google_token }, contacts => {
    txtTopRatedMoviesTo(contacts)
  })

  setTimeout(runApp, 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
}

runApp()
```

<Spoiler name = "Callback HELL">

The above code is good, readable code with good function names.

The below example, with multiple nested `request` function calls, is a form of
bad code called **callback hell**. We'll learn a little more about this later.

```jsx
const request = require('request')

const runApp = () => {
  // A Google token is needed so Google knows it's me
  request('google.com/contacts', { token: google_token }, contacts => {
    request('netflix.com/api/topCatalog', movies => {
      people.forEach(number => {
        // A Twilio token is needed so Twilio knows it's me
        //    and charges me for every message I send
        request('twilio.com/api/sendMessage', {
          token: twilio_token,
          to: number
        })
      })
    })
  })

  setTimeout(runApp, 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
}

runApp()
```

</Spoiler>

## Request

There are many libraries we can use to send a request, and the `request` library
is one of them. You might have noticed it in the above examples. You can use
this library to send requests to APIs and even to retrieve web pages like your
browser does.

To run the below code, you'll need to install request by running
`npm install request`.

```jsx
const request = require('request')

// We are sending a request to a Pokemon API to get Pokemon data.
// This one actually works!
request(
  'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?offset=20&limit=20',
  (err, res, data) => {
    console.log(data) // data is JSON

    // We use JSON.parse to parse the JSON back into an object
    const pokeInfo = JSON.parse(data)

    console.log(pokeInfo.results) // Array of pokemon!
  }
)
```

### URLs

<div>
  <Image
    src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js3/urlStructure.png"
    width="480"
    height="77"
  />
</div>

A typical URL looks like the above.

- **Protocol**: Specifies **how** data is sent over the Internet
- **Hostname**: Helps identify **where** to send a request to
- **Path & Query Parameters**: Helps the server determine **what** to do with
  the request
  - Query parameters should be used for data. `&` separates the different pieces
    of data.
    - `https://macys.com/shoes?size=4&brand=allbirds&type=outdoors`

When you type a URL into your browser, the browser sends a request just like the
Pokemon example above. In fact, if you send a request to any website, such as
[https://news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com), you will see the
same HTML response that the browser gets back when it sends the request. The
browser then reads the HTML and follows the instructions defined by each tag.

```jsx
const request = require('request')
request('https://news.ycombinator.com', (err, res, data) => {
  console.log(data) // data is a string of HTML tags
})
```

> **A note about APIs** Different APIs/companies will respond with data in
> different formats. Register.gov, Facebook.com, google.com, and c0d3.com all
> have different data structures. They may respond back with an array of
> objects, an object of objects, an array of strings, etc. So you gotta try out
> each API before coding your project! Usually software engineers try out APIs
> by using [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/) or by writing requests into a

## Exercises

1. Send a request to
   `[https://www.c0d3.com/api/lessons](https://www.c0d3.com/api/lessons)` and
   console.log all the titles.

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

Don’t forget that if you want to do anything interesting with the results of a
request you’ll usually have to `JSON.parse` it.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler>

First, open the url in your browser to understand the data. If the data looks
messy, installing a browser extension like
[JSON View](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview/) would
help. Looking at the data, we will have 10 titles, so if our function worked out
`console.log` should be called 10 times.

1. **Tests**

   We are redefining `console.log` to overwrite its original functionality
   (**Mocking**)

   Since there are 10 lessons, after we run `getLessons`, our custom
   `console.log` should have run 10 times.

   Therefore, we keep a variable `i` to keep track of how many times the
   function has been called.

   `getLesson` takes time to run, so we will give it 2 seconds to run before
   expecting `i` value to be 10.

   [Mocking](/docs/mocking)

   ```jsx
   jest.mock('request')
   const request = require('request')
   const lessons = require('./printLessonTitles')

   describe('lessons', () => {
     test(`console log should not be called if lessons `, () => {
       request.mockClear()
       lessons.printLessons()
       expect(request.mock.calls.length).toEqual(1)
       const firstCall = request.mock.calls[0]
       expect(firstCall[0]).toEqual('https://c0d3.com/api/lessons')
     })

     test('console.log should be called once if length of lessons array is 1', () => {
       request.mockClear()
       lessons.printLessons()
       console.log = jest.fn()
       request.mock.calls[0][1](
         {},
         {},
         JSON.stringify([
           {
             title: 'testing'
           }
         ])
       )
       expect(request.mock.calls.length).toEqual(1)
       expect(console.log.mock.calls[0][0]).toEqual('testing')
     })

     test('console.log should return 3 times if lessons array has 3 elements', () => {
       request.mockClear()
       lessons.printLessons()

       console.log = jest.fn()
       request.mock.calls[0][1](
         {},
         {},
         JSON.stringify([
           {
             title: 'Testing1'
           },
           {
             title: 'Testing2'
           },
           {
             title: 'Testing3'
           }
         ])
       )
       expect(console.log.mock.calls.length).toEqual(3)
       expect(console.log.mock.calls[0][0]).toEqual('Testing1')
       expect(console.log.mock.calls[1][0]).toEqual('Testing2')
       expect(console.log.mock.calls[2][0]).toEqual('Testing3')
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   module.exports = {
     printLessons: () => {
       // your code here...
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - Require `request`.
   - Send the request to
     [`https://c0d3.com/api/lessons`](https://c0d3.com/api/lessons).

   content:

   ```jsx
   <h1>title1</h1><h1>title2</h1>...<h1>titleX</h1>
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

Asynchronous behavior makes it tricky to split your code into functions, say by
getting the lesson titles in one function and writing them into a file in
another, because the request doesn't _return_ its results. As you get better
with promises, you'll learn how to easily split these tasks up, but for now you
can plan on putting everything that depends on the results inside the `request`.

That was a long function, wasn't it? In the next section, you'll see how to make
multiple request calls **much** cleaner and easier to read. For now, let's look
at how we went about coding this:

**Examples:** The function should only do one thing—examine 20 Pokemon and find
the heaviest, then console.log it.

**Function shape:** We know the main function will be a `request`. We'll send 20
additional requests to find the weight of each Pokemon, but because they'll need
the URLs returned by the first request, they'll have to be inside the first
request's callback function.

Only after all 20 weights have been found can we use something like `reduce` to
compare them and find the heaviest. That's tricky because we don't know in which
order they'll come back! So _each of the 20 callback functions_ will have to
check if it's the last, and if so, complete the program by comparing the Pokemon
and logging the heaviest.

```jsx
request('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/', (err, res, body) => {
  // parse the JSON body
  parsedJson.results.forEach((el) => {
    request(/*URL for this Pokemon*/, (err, pokeRes, pokeBody) => {
    // store this Pokemon's data for later
    // if all 20 weights have been found:
    // compare the Pokemon
    // log the heaviest one
    })
  })
})
```

**Think:** We'll need to start an array to keep track of the names and weights
once they've been found _outside_ the `forEach` so that each `request` can add
to it. Once this array has 20 elements (the same number as the original results
list) we're ready to compare them, which we'll do with `reduce`.

**Code:** Here we create our `const pokemonList = []` array, parse the JSON each
time it comes in, push each newly found weight to `pokemonList`, and write our
`if` condition and `reduce` call. We're done!

**Test:** Running the code as-is should always log Venusaur. If you want to test
it on a bigger data set, see the next exercise for how to grab more than 20
Pokemon from the API. For example, if you change the limit to 100, the answer
should become golem!

6. Send a request to

   images.

   (To get 100 Pokemon instead of 20, just pass a parameter into the URL:
   [`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=100`](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/).)

# Promises

If you are not careful when using the `request` library, you may end up in
**callback hell**.

Code that resembles callback hell is highly discouraged because it can get
really confusing and difficult for other engineers to understand. In fact, our
code in the last couple of exercises was starting to get a little complex with
nested `request` calls.

If you submit code that looks like callback hell it will most likely be
rejected.

```jsx
request('https://a.com', (aErr, aRes, aData) => {
  request('https://b.com', (bErr, bRes, bData) => {
    request('https://c.com', (cErr, cRes, cData) => {
      request('https://d.com', (dErr, dRes, dData) => {
        request('https://e.com', (eErr, eRes, eData) => {
          // In a large codebase, it may be very difficult
          //    to get to the end of the chain (eData)
          //    since the code is in the middle of the page
          calculateResult(aData, bData, cData, dData, eData)
        })
      })
    })
  })
}) // Bad coding pattern
```

To help junior engineers avoid making mistakes like the above, functions can
return an object called a **promise**. A promise represents the eventual result
of an asynchronous action (e.g. making a network request, writing files to the
filesystem).

The two most commonly used promise methods are:

1. `then`
   - `then` expects a function argument, which will be called when the promise
     is done.
   - When the promise is eventually fulfilled, `then` receives the resulting
     value and calls the function, passing it this value as an argument.
   - The function can return any value (numbers, strings, or any other data).
   - Finally, `then` returns another promise with the value returned by the
     function.
2. `catch`
   - `catch` expects a function argument, which will be called when the promise
     encounters an error.
   - When the promise encounters an error, `catch` receives an error object and
     calls the function, passing it this error as an argument

## Axios

`axios` is a library that also sends requests, but unlike `request`, where you
pass in a function as the second argument, axios **returns a promise**,
\*\*\*\*and you pass the next function into the promise's `then` function. This
makes it easy to organize a chain of functions that depend on each other's
results, listing them top-down instead of nesting them and creating callback
hell.

Instead of passing a function as a second argument, you pass the function as an
argument into the return promise's `then` function.

```jsx
// You need to install axios
// because it is not a nodejs core (libraries that come installed with nodejs)
// To install, run `npm install axios` before running this file.
const axios = require('axios')
const allData = []
const resultOfDataPromise = axios('https://a.com')
  .then(aData => {
    allData.push(aData)
    return axios('https://b.com')
  })
  .then(bData => {
    allData.push(bData)
    return axios('https://c.com')
  })
  .then(cData => {
    allData.push(cData)
    return axios('https://d.com')
  })
  .then(dData => {
    allData.push(dData)
    return axios('https://e.com')
  })
  .then(eData => {
    allData.push(eData)
    // In a large codebase, using returning promise objects can help your
    // code flow in a logical way (top down) so the last call in the
    // chain (eData) is towards the end of the page.
    return calculateResult(allData)
  })
  .catch(eErr => {
    // Find the eErr variable in the callback hell example
    // and try to understand how this works!
  })
```

Another benefit is that a promise's `.then` function always returns another
promise, allowing you to chain them. Continuing from the example above, you can
chain from the computed result:

```jsx
const userNamesPromise = resultOfDataPromise.then(result => {
  // result is the return value from calling
  // calculateResult(allData) above.
  return getUserNames(result)
})

// To use the final usernames result (i.e. to print it out)
userNamesPromise.then(userNames => {
  console.log(userNames)
})
```

## Fetch

The browser provides you with a function called `fetch` that allows you to send
requests and returns a promise. Unlike `axios`, you must do an extra step of
parsing the JSON response into an object.

`node-fetch` is a not a nodeJS core library (meaning it did not come bundled
when you installed NodeJS), so you need to install the library before using it
by running `npm install node-fetch`.

### Example

Here's an example of how fetch might be used in a web environment. We are
sending a request to `[c0d3.com](http://c0d3.com)` and
[displaying how many lessons](https://songz.c0d3.com/js3/req.html) there are.

_Note that when using fetch in the browser we don't need to `require` it; the
browser supports fetch automatically. Later examples will include
`require('node-fetch')` in case you want to follow along in node._

```jsx
<h1 class="display"></h1>
<script>
const display = document.querySelector('.display')
fetch('https://www.c0d3.com/api/lessons').then( (res) => {
  return res.json()
}).then( (data) => {
  display.innerText = `there are ${data.length} lessons`
})
</script>
```

Notice how we create two promises here: one to get the data using `json()` and
another to display it. `json()` is different from `JSON.parse()`; instead of a
helper function to be used on any text, it's a function of the fetch library,
and runs asynchronously, which is why it needs its own promise.

### Exercise

Complete the below all the way up to [e.com](http://e.com) so that it has the
same result as the axios example!

```jsx
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

const allData = []
const resultOfDataPromise = fetch('https://a.com').then( (r) => {
	// json is a function that turns the response string into a JavaScript data type
  return r.json()
}).then( (aData) => {
  allData.push(aData)
  return fetch('https://b.com')
}).then(
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
const allData = []
const resultOfDataPromise = fetch('https://a.com')
  .then(r => {
    return r.json()
  })
  .then(aData => {
    allData.push(aData)
    return fetch('https://b.com')
  })
  .then(bData => {
    return bData.json()
  })
  .then(bData => {
    allData.push(bData)
    return fetch('https://c.com')
  })
  .then(cData => {
    return cData.json()
  })
  .then(cData => {
    allData.push(cData)
    return fetch('https://d.com')
  })
  .then(dData => {
    return dData.json()
  })
  .then(dData => {
    allData.push(dData)
    return fetch('https://e.com')
  })
  .then(eData => {
    return eData.json()
  })
  .then(eData => {
    allData.push(eData)
    return calculateResult(allData)
  })
```

**AJAX:** Sending a request from the browser

- If someone tells you they know ajax, it means that they know how to send
  requests from the browser.
- If you are able to run the examples above on the browser, it means that you
  know how to use `fetch` to send a request from the browser. So you can now
  claim that you know ajax too!

## Promise.all

Many times you may want to send more than one request at once. For example, if
you want to look up the prices of 20 houses in your neighborhood (or the weights
of 20 Pokemon), you want to send all the requests to get the data at once, then
do something with all the data (such as finding the cheapest house or the
heaviest Pokemon).

To do this, you can use `Promise.all`, which takes in an array of promise
objects and returns a promise. When the `then` function runs, the argument
function will get an array of responses.

```jsx
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

const pokeNumbers = [
  37, // vulpix
  38, // ninetales
  39, // jigglypuff
  40 // wigglytuff
]

const arrayPromises = pokeNumbers.map(num => {
  return fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${num}`).then(result => {
    // result is an array of response objects, one for each request
    // we need to parse the JSON in each result
    return result.json()
  })
})

Promise.all(arrayPromises).then(results => {
  // results is now an array of objects
  // we can do something with it, like
  results.forEach(e => {
    console.log(`${e.name} weighs ${e.weight}`)
  })
})
```

<Spoiler name = "Student Questions / Rough Explanations">

Here are some questions students asked about Promises that students have asked.

The responses are raw, in chat format.

- promise !== data
  - That's why I couldn't see the data when I console.log() promises, the
    computer said just [promise]
- I'm learning promises, I don't understand why that json() runs asynchronously
  means that it needs its own promise.
- Also, I don't know why fetch is useful in this example. I assume that if it
  was axios, we don't have to parse it and the code is shorter.
  - Because browsers only support `fetch`, No `axios` in the front end (Unless
    you bring in a new library)
- I thought that... using .json() instead of JSON.parse() is necessary because
  .json() makes sure that the computer operates the functions in order

  - response comes in patches. Sometimes the data a BIG right?

    so as data response comes back

    it's converting into json

    `JSON.parse( string )` -> the string has to exist completely first

    but with response over the internet, this is a little tricky

    because.... responses comes in backets

    like... you ask your mom for 100k.... your mom sends you 1k every month

    like.... the internet works that way

    does that make more sense?

    so.... `res.json()` -> returns a promise. It takes the responses and as the
    packets come in, it puts them together as an object. then resolve when
    everything has been received

    that's what happens in the background.

# Hacking and Debugging

Almost everything that happens in your browser involves sending requests. To
look at all the requests that a website sends out, you can open your console and
look at the Network tab. Click on each request to find out more.
