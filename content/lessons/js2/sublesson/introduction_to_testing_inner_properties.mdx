# Introduction to Testing

Up till now we've introduced exercises by giving examples of what the function
is supposed to do. As our functions get more complex, we need to specify in more
detail what right and wrong behavior for each function looks like. One good way
to do this is by writing **test cases**.

Testing is an extremely important part of software engineering. When you test
your code, you make sure that it works. Testing also gives you a permanent
record of what correct behavior for your code looks like. In the future, if
someone changes your code and breaks it, your tests will reject their changes.
This way, tests can help ensure that your code will keep working forever.

Developers have lots of tools they can use to make testing easy and reliable. In
this section we'll introduce one of these tools, called Jest. Starting with this
lesson, we'll describe exercises by showing you test cases that your solution
should pass. Then in JS4, you'll learn how to write your own test cases.

## Using jest

Follow these steps to create and run a test file that you can use to test your
solutions to the Preflight exercises.

1. Create a new folder (or use an existing one)
2. We will be using the `jest` framework to run our tests, so we need to install
   it.

   `npm i jest`

3. We need to setup your folder for using `jest` . To do that, initialize your
   project

   `npm init -y`

4. Create a file for your solutions to this section. Call it `preflight.js`.
5. Create a file for the tests. Call it `preflight.test.js`. The word `test` in
   the filename is important; Jest will only run files with `test` in the
   filename.

   Don't worry about what to put into this file just yet, the examples will
   guide you through what to put in.

6. First tell your test file to include the file that will have your solutions:

   ```jsx
   // fn will be an object with all your preflight solutions
   const fn = require('./preflight.js')
   ```

We're now ready to start writing functions. We'll do the first one step-by-step
as an example.

## Example

Write a function named removeCharX that removes the character at the given index
from a string.

```jsx
removeCharX("We're in the endgame now.", 1) // "W're in the endgame now."
```

**Testing this** - In the following 5 steps, step 1 is most important
(examples). These examples will be your tests and the following instructions
will show you how to create tests and run them. After that, put your examples
into the test and run it.

1. In the `preflight.js` file, set up the object that will be exported to the
   test file and write your solution. You'll learn more about objects in JS3,
   but for now you just need to know that `allFuns` is an object.

   ```jsx
   const allFuns = {}

   const removeCharX = ( ... ) => {
     // Your code goes here
   }

   allFuns.removeCharX = removeCharX // You need this line for every function
                                     // you write
   ```

2. Add this line to `preflight.js`. As you solve more exercises, just keep this
   line at the end.

   ```jsx
   module.exports = allFuns
   ```

3. Open the Tests toggle and paste the code into your `preflight.test.js` file.

<Spoiler name = "Tests">

```jsx
describe('removeCharX function', () => {
  it('should remove the first character', () => {
    const str = "We're in the endgame now."
    const result = fn.removeCharX(str, 0)
    expect(result).toEqual("e're in the endgame now.")
  })
  it('return the original string', () => {
    const str = 'a'
    const result = fn.removeCharX(str, 3)
    expect(result).toEqual('a')
  })
  it('return the original string', () => {
    const str = 'abc'
    const result = fn.removeCharX(str, -3)
    expect(result).toEqual('abc')
  })
})
```

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler>

1. **Function Shape**

   ```jsx
   const removeCharX = (str, idx) => {}
   ```

2. **Explanation**
   1. We need a variable to keep track of where we are `i` and it starts from 0.
      We need another variable `result` to collect all the new letters.
   2. If `i` goes to the end of the string, we return the result.
   3. If `i` is not equal to `idx`, we add letter to the result
   4. Continue to next iteration of i
3. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const removeCharX = (str, idx, i = 0, result = '') => {
     if (i === str.length) {
       return result
     }
     if (i !== idx) {
       result = result + str[i]
     }
     return removeCharX(str, idx, i + 1, result)
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

4. Run the test with `jest preflight.test.js`.

<Spoiler name = 'If you have problems running jest'>

Run it directly from the library: `node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js`

If that doesn't work:

- Try installing jest globally: `npm i -g jest`, and run it again: `jest`
- If you get an `EACCES` error, then you need to run it with sudo:
  `sudo npm i -g jest`

</Spoiler>

5. To have your tests automatically re-run as you edit the code or add new
   tests, run jest with the `--watch` option in one terminal and leave it
   running. As you change your code in your editor (VS Code, vim, etc.) your
   tests will run automatically. Press `q` to exit when you're done.

   `jest --watch preflight.test.js`

For each new exercise, click the Tests toggle and add the tests to your
`preflight.test.js` file. Then add your solution to the `preflight.js` file and
re-run the tests (or leave them running with `--watch`).

## Exercises

1. Write a function named `less3Diff` that determines whether two strings have
   fewer than 3 different characters. Both arguments will have the same length.

   ```jsx
   less3Diff('spiderman', 'spyderman') // true because only character at index 2
   // is different
   less3Diff('spiderman', 'mary jane') // false
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('less3Diff function', () => {
     it('should return false on strings with >= 3 letters different', () => {
       const result = fn.less3Diff('spiderman', 'mary jane')
       expect(result).toEqual(false)
     })
     it('should return true if < 3 letters different', () => {
       const result = fn.less3Diff('spiderman', 'spyderman')
       expect(result).toEqual(true)
     })
     it('should always return true on strings < 3 characters', () => {
       const result = fn.less3Diff('jk', 'lm')
       expect(result).toEqual(true)
     })
     it('should return false on strings equal to 3 and that are different', () => {
       const result = fn.less3Diff('cho', 'tis')
       expect(result).toEqual(false)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const less3Diff = (str1, str2) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given string `str1` and string `str2`.
   - We will need an additional variable for index (let's say `i`) which starts
     at 0.
   - We will need an additional variable to keep count of different characters
     (let's say `differences` ) which starts at 0 as well.
   - When index `i` equals the length of `str1`,
     - return true*.*
   - When `differences` is greater than 2,
     - return false*.*
   - When the first character of string `str1` does not equal first character of
     second string `str2`,
     - Update `differences` by incrementing it by 1.
   - Continue.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const less3Diff = (str1, str2, i = 0, differences = 0) => {
     if (differences > 2) {
       return false
     }
     if (i === str1.length) {
       return true
     }
     if (str1[i] !== str2[i]) {
       differences = differences + 1
     }
     return less3Diff(str1, str2, i + 1, differences)
   }
   ```

2. Write a function named `reverso` that takes in a string, and returns a new
   string with the input string reversed.

   ```jsx
   reverso('sneakers') // srekaens
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   From here on you'll notice that some of our test suites include tests on
   unlikely input. After all, most people who use your `reverso` function
   probably won't try to reverse an empty string. But your code should ready to
   handle situations that test the limits of the data types it works with.
   Engineers call these **edge cases**, and you'll see them pop up in many of
   our tests!

   ```jsx
   describe('reverso function', () => {
     it('should reverse "sneakers"', () => {
       const result = fn.reverso('sneakers')
       expect(result).toEqual('srekaens')
     })
     it('should reverse strings of one letter', () => {
       const result = fn.reverso('s')
       expect(result).toEqual('s')
     })
     it('should return an empty string when given an empty string', () => {
       const result = fn.reverso('')
       expect(result).toEqual('')
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const reverso = (str, i = 0, result = '') => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given a string `str`.
   - We will need a second variable for index (let's say `i`) which starts at 0.
   - We will need a third variable to keep track of our reversed string (let's
     say `result` ) which starts at empty string "".
   - When the length of string `result` equals to the length of string `str`,
     - return `result`.
   - Continue.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const reverso = (str, i = 0, result = '') => {
     if (result.length === str.length) {
       return result
     }
     return reverso(str, i + 1, str[i] + result)
   }
   ```

3. Write a function named `delayAndCall` that takes in 2 parameters, a number
   and a function, and returns a function

   When the returned function is called, the input function will execute after
   the input number of milliseconds.

   ```jsx
   const fun = delayAndCall(1000, () => {
     console.log('I am groot')
   })
   fun() // after 1 second, 'I am groot' will be logged
   fun() // after 1 second, 'I am groot' will be logged
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   // Don't worry about understanding all the functions used to test
   //   this function. But they use natural language, so you might
   //   be able to figure them out!
   describe('delayAndCall function', () => {
     jest.useFakeTimers()
     it('should run function after 1000 milliseconds', () => {
       const callback = jest.fn()
       const fun = fn.delayAndCall(1000, callback)
       fun()
       expect(callback).not.toBeCalled() // It shouldn't run right away
       jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000)
       expect(callback).toBeCalled() // But after 1000ms
       // it should have run
     })
     it('should run callback repeatedly', () => {
       const callback = jest.fn()
       const fun = fn.delayAndCall(1000, callback)
       fun()
       expect(callback).not.toBeCalled() // It shouldn't run right away
       jest.runAllTimers()
       expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1) // Should have been
       // called once
       fun()
       jest.runAllTimers()
       expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2) // Now it should have
       // been called twice
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const delayAndCall = (time, fn) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given number `time` and a function `fn`.
   - Inside the return function,
     - call `setTimeout` with given function `fn` and number `time`.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const delayAndCall = (time, fn) => {
     return () => {
       setTimeout(fn, time)
     }
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

4. Write a function named `primeMachine` that takes in a number and returns a
   function.

   - Each time the returned function is called, return the next prime number
     (starting from the input number).
   - _(For a new coder, this can be a hard problem. This problem was asked
     during an onsite interview, so it is okay if you can't come up with the
     answer yourself. This problem involves creating other functions to help you
     get the correct solution.)_

   ```jsx
   const getPrime = primeMachine(10)
   getPrime() // 11
   getPrime() // 13
   getPrime() // 17
   getPrime() // 19
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Interview response (after interviewer asked the question)">

### Step 1: Examples

I'm going to start writing a few examples (x3) to make sure I understand the
problem.

```jsx
// example 1: I intentionally picked a negative number
const getPrime1 = primeMachine(-2)
getPrime1() // Should return 2? Interviewer: Yes
getPrime1() // Should return 3? Interviewer: Yes

// example 2: I intentionally picked a prime number to start
const getPrime2 = primeMachine(5)
getPrime2() // Should return 7? Interviewer: Yes
getPrime2() // Should return 11? Interviewer: Yes

// example 3: Just used the example I was given
const getPrime3 = primeMachine(10)
getPrime3() // Should return 11? Interviewer: Yes
getPrime3() // Should return 13? Interviewer: Yes
getPrime3() // Should return 17? Interviewer: Yes
```

### Step 2: Function Shape

Just so I don't have to think about this much, I'll just write out the shape of
the function because it is obvious and get it out of the way. (Interviewer: OK)

I know that the `primeMachine` function takes in a parameter, and returns a
function.

```jsx
const primeMachine = start => {
  return () => {}
}
```

### Step 3: Explaining the Solution

Okay, so we probably need a few helper functions. I need a function to check to
see if a number is prime. And then I also need another function to get the next
prime number. I'll assume I have these 2 functions that I need and will just
focus on solving the `primeMachine` function first. Then I'll come back to them.

When the `primeMachine` function is called, we need to check for out-of-range
input (like < 2) and change them to 1. Also, if the input is a prime number
itself, we should add 1 to it so we get the next one.

When the returned function is called, it will return the result of calling the
`getNextPrime` function. After getting the result, we need to increment the
input number by 1.

### Step 4: Coding the Solution

In this step, our main task is to write the codes for `primeMachine` function.

We will write the codes for `isPrime` and `getNetPrime` functions in step 5 if
requested by the interviewer.

```jsx
const isPrime = num => {
  // Returns true or false. Don't actually write anything more beyond this.
  // we will write the codes in step 5 if requested
}

const getNextPrime = num => {
  // Returns the next prime number which is >= than the num input.
  // Don't write anything beyond this.
  // we will write the codes in step 5 if requested
}

const primeMachine = start => {
  if (start < 2) {
    start = 1 // Any number smaller than 2 is not a prime.
  }
  if (isPrime(start)) {
    start = start + 1
  }
  return () => {
    const result = getNextPrime(start)
    start = start + 1
    return result
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Testing Original Examples

I went through the original 3 examples from step 1 to make sure the result was
correct step by step.

Then I asked the interviewer: Do you want me to implement (write) the `isPrime`
and `getNextPrime` functions?

- Usually at this point, the interviewer might be impressed enough to know that
  you know how to implement these 2 functions and move on to the next question.
- If not, they might pick either one of the 2 functions and tell you to
  implement it. Just repeat these 5 steps.

If you could not figure out this function yourself, follow the 5 steps above and
solve for `isPrime` and `getNextPrime` functions. Answers are included in the
answer toggle for this problem.

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('primeMachine function', () => {
     it('should return next 2 primes starting with a negative number', () => {
       const getPrime1 = fn.primeMachine(-2)
       expect(getPrime1()).toEqual(2)
       expect(getPrime1()).toEqual(3)
     })
     it('should not return starting number if prime', () => {
       const getPrime2 = fn.primeMachine(5)
       expect(getPrime2()).toEqual(7)
       expect(getPrime2()).toEqual(11)
     })
     it('should return next 3 primes starting at 10', () => {
       const getPrime3 = fn.primeMachine(10)
       expect(getPrime3()).toEqual(11)
       expect(getPrime3()).toEqual(13)
       expect(getPrime3()).toEqual(17)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const isPrime = num => {}

   const getNextPrime = () => {}

   const primeMachine = () => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given a number `num` .
   - You need a helper function `isPrime` to determine which number is a prime.
   - You need another helper function `getNextPrime` to get the next prime
     number starting from the given number `num`.
   - In the `primeMachine` function,
     - Pass in the result from running the `getNextPrime` function as a
       parameter.
     - We name the result from running the `getNextPrime` function on `start` to
       be passed in as a parameter.
     - When the value of `start` is less than 2,
       - change to value of `start` to 1.
   - When `start` is prime,
     - increment `start` by 1.
   - Inside the return function,
     - We need an additional variable (let's say `result`) that stores the
       result of running `getNextPrime` function.
     - Pass in `start` as argument inside this `getNextPrime` function.
     - Now `start` equals `result` plus 1.
     - return `result`
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const isPrime = (num, start = 2) => {
     if (num < start) {
       return false
     }
     if (num === start) {
       return true
     }
     if (num % start === 0) {
       return false
     }
     return isPrime(num, start + 1)
   }

   const getNextPrime = start => {
     if (isPrime(start)) {
       return start
     }
     return getNextPrime(start + 1)
   }

   const primeMachine = start => {
     if (start < 2) {
       start = 1 // any number smaller than 2 is not a prime.
     }
     if (isPrime(start)) {
       start = start + 1
     }
     return () => {
       const result = getNextPrime(start)
       start = result + 1
       return result
     }
   }
   ```

# Overview

In the last lesson, you got started with HTML and learned more about functions.
If you had any issues solving any of the **Preflight** questions, please review
the previous lesson by doing the exercises and challenges again until you're
comfortable. This lesson will rely heavily on the foundations covered in the
previous lesson in two parts:

The first part will build on your existing HTML knowledge and introduce you to
more element properties.

The second part will teach you what you need to know about **arrays**, a
powerful non-primitive data type in JavaScript.

Like in the previous lesson, make sure you follow along by running the example
code yourself. If the concept is new to you, do not copy and paste. You will
learn better if you write out the code. Ready? Let's get started!

# HTML/JS

In JS1 you learned about:

- Definitions: `tags`, `elements`, and `attributes`
- Browser functions: `document.queryselector` and `alert`
- Element properties: `onclick` and `value`

In this section we will learn a new element and a new property that can make
your websites more interactive. To follow along, first launch VS Code, create a
new .html file and view/open it in your browser.

## div tag

The `<div>` tag is one of the most important HTML tags in modern web design.
This very simple tag `<div>` defines a container or section that is used to
group other elements together inside it. All HTML elements inside the section
are called **child** elements of the `<div>`. For example:

```html
<div>
  <input type="text" class="username" />
  <input type="password" class="password" />
  <button>Log in</button>
</div>
```

In the example above, the two `input` elements and the `button` element are all
**children** of the `div` element. They are also **sibling** elements of each
other.

Real websites have many thousands of elements, and developers use `div`s to
group them into logical parts like “header,” “sidebar,” “body,” or “chat
window.” Each div can often be further broken into more divs. Therefore, a
typical web page has a hierarchy of several divs deep.

## innerHTML property

We already learned how to change elements like input boxes by setting their
values. By setting an element's `innerHTML` property, you can dynamically add
any other elements to the page. For example, you can change your page behavior
as follows:

```html
<div class="container"></div>
<script>
  const box = document.querySelector('.container')
  box.innerHTML = `
	<input type="text" class="username" />
	<input type="password" class="password" />
	<button>Log in</button>
`
</script>
```

In the example above, we are using JavaScript to dynamically add three HTML tags
inside the `div` tag. The 3 lines of HTML after `box.innerHTML =` might look a
little out of place, but they're actually one long string! Recall from JS0 how
we can use `"`, `'`, or `` ` `` to create a string. We chose `` ` `` here
because it allows us to easily include line breaks inside the string, and
because the HTML is already using quotation marks. If we had used `"` to begin
the string, the first attribute would have ended it and broken our code.

If you want to get a reference of an element that is inserted by JavaScript, pay
attention and make sure you write the document.querySelector to search the
element **after** adding the element tag!

**Good**

This will work because we are getting the `.submitButton` element after setting
innerHTML.

```jsx
<div class="container"></div>
<button class="showButton">Show</button>
<script>
const box = document.querySelector('.container')
const button = document.querySelector('.showButton')

button.onclick = () => {
  box.innerHTML = `
		<input type="text" class="username" />
		<input type="password" class="password" />
		<button class="submitButton">submit</button>
	`

	const submitButton = document.querySelector('.submitButton')
  submitButton.onclick = ...
}
</script>
```

**Bad**

The browser will throw an error because it is trying to get the `.submitButton`
element before it exists.

```jsx
<div class="container"></div>
<button class="showButton">Show</button>
<script>
const box = document.querySelector('.container')
const button = document.querySelector('.showButton')

const submitButton = document.querySelector('.submitButton')
submitButton.onclick = ...

button.onclick = () => {
  box.innerHTML = `
		<input type="text" class="username" />
		<input type="password" class="password" />
		<button class="submitButton">submit</button>
	`
}
</script>
```

**Be careful when setting the `innerHTML` property**

Elements lose their properties when they're being replaced by other elements. In
the example below, we bind an **onclick** function to the showButton button.
When the showButton button is clicked, the element inside the `<div>` tag is
totally replaced with an `<h1>` tag and a new button element. The original
button element has been replaced although the new button has exactly the same
class name and text. It's technically a brand new element. Replace the current
contents of your page with the below code to see what happens:

```html
<input class="inputText" type="text" />
<div class="container">
  <button class="showButton">Show</button>
</div>
<script>
  const box = document.querySelector('.container')
  const input = document.querySelector('.inputText')
  let button = document.querySelector('.showButton')

  button.onclick = () => {
    box.innerHTML = `
		<h1>${input.value}</h1>
    <button class="showButton">Show</button>
	`
    // When you click the button, its onclick function will replace
    //   button element inside the box with the new innerHtml property.
    // Now if you click the button again, nothing happens.
  }
</script>
```

> Keep in mind that when you set the `innerHTML` property, whatever was there
> previously is gone. In other words, after setting the `innerHTML` of an
> element, all variables for the children elements are no longer usable.

In the above example, whenever the button is clicked, the clicked button is to
be replaced with an identical new button. So in the current `onclick` function,
after we set the container div's innerHtml, we need to select this new button
and give it an `onclick` function that sets the container's innerHtml including
a new button, selects that button and gives it an `onclick` function that... See
the problem here? We need to create a function that will run every time the
button is clicked, and it needs to assign _itself_ as the button's `onclick`
function. Replacing our current `button.onclick` function with the following
code will make it work as many times as the button is clicked:

```jsx
const prepareTheButton = () => {
  box.innerHTML = `
    <h1>${input.value}</h1>
    <button class="showButton">Show</button>
    `
  button = document.querySelector('.showButton')
  button.onclick = prepareTheButton
}

button.onclick = prepareTheButton
```

## innerText property

If you do not wish to create new HTML elements and simply wish to change the
text inside an element, you should use the `innerText` property. The `innerText`
property will treat your strings as literal strings instead of `html` tags.

```jsx
<h1 class="heading"></h1>
<script>
const h1Element = document.querySelector('.heading')
h1Element.innerText = "The hardest choices require the strongest wills."
</script>
```

## Exercises

Some of these UI exercises may seem intimidating. When you feel overwhelmed,
take a deep breath, think about _what you know_, and make sure to start with
that. When you work as a software engineer, you will have to handle projects
that seem really intimidating. In these situations, it is important to think
about what you know and understand, then slowly branch out from there piece by
piece.

> Good engineers spend the majority of their time thinking, not coding. Whether
> you are working on these exercises, interviewing for a software engineering
> job, or working on projects, make sure you spend the first half of your
> allotted time thinking through the problem before actually starting to code.

1. [Create an h1 element that says](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/1.html)
   `Change Me`, an input box, and a submit button. When the submit button is
   clicked, the h1 element is changed to whatever is inside the input box.

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Create an input, h1 and submit button
2. Add a class to all three elements and target them using querySelector
3. When button is clicked, set the innerText of the h1 tag to the input value

</Spoiler>

2. [Start with a button called Start.](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/2.html) When
   you click on the button the page changes to show an input box and a button
   (Cancel). When the Cancel button is clicked, the page goes back to its
   original state.

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Create a container and inside of that container put a start button
2. Select the start button with querySelector and set the start button's onclick
   event to a function. This function replaces the container’s innerHTML with an
   input box and a cancel button
   1. Set the cancel button onclick's event to a function that replaces the
      container's innerHTML with a start button.
   2. Repeat #2 (need to turn step 2 into a function `startApp` )
3. Run `startApp` function.

</Spoiler>

3. [Build a closure UI](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/3.html). BTW, UI means User
   Interface which is the means that the user and a computer system interacts,
   like the use of input box or buttons. (There are many ways to do this. The
   provided solution is not the only solution.)

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Start with a `<div>` element named container. Within the `<div>` element, add
   an input box that only allows numerical value to be entered and a button
   named start. You also need a h1 Tag (outside the container).
2. Using querySelector, get the `h1` and container `div` elements.
3. Create a function named `solution` that takes in a number as a parameter and
   returns a function. Let's name the number as a.
   1. Before returning the function, select the input element and get the
      numerical value of the input element. Set the h1 element's innerText to
      that value and a "+" character (Example: `5 +` )
   2. The returned function takes in a number as a parameter. When this function
      is run, select the input element and pass the numerical value as an
      argument to the returned function. Return the sum of this value and the
      number a from step 3 above.
4. Select the start button. When start button is clicked,
   1. Get the input element. Pass the value (convert to number first) as an
      argument into the function named `solution` .
   2. store the return value `result` .
   3. Set container's innerHTML to input, add button, and clear button.
   4. when `clear` button is clicked, replace the elements inside the container
      with an input box element and a start button element. Clear h1 element,
      then run step 4 (to add onclick function for the start button).
   5. When add button is clicked, select the input element and get the value.
      Run the `result` function and pass in the value (convert to number). Set
      h1 element's inner text. (Example: `5 + 244 = 249` )

</Spoiler>

4. [Hello String Generator UI](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/4.html). Create a page
   with an input box and a button. The input box takes a number, and when the
   button is clicked, `Hello` repeated that many times is displayed inside an
   `<h1>` element.

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Create an input box that takes in a number, a generate button, h1 element
2. Write a function named solution that takes in a number named x and returns a
   string of "hello" repeated x number of times.
3. When the generate button is clicked, run solution . The h1 element's
   innerText is set to the result string.

</Spoiler>

5. [String Breaker.](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/5.html) Split the input string
   into single characters and add the individual characters into their own
   `<h1>` element. For example, breaking `Batman` will generate:

   ```html
   <h1>B</h1>
   <h1>a</h1>
   <h1>t</h1>
   <h1>m</h1>
   <h1>a</h1>
   <h1>n</h1>
   ```

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Create an input box, generate button and a container div.
2. Write a function named `solution` that takes in a string and returns a
   string. Example:

   ```jsx
   solution('hello')
   // returns "<h1>h</h1><h1>e</h1><h1>l</h1><h1>l</h1><h1>o</h1>"
   ```

3. When the generate button is clicked, run the solution function and pass the
   inputbox value as argument. Set container div's innerHTML to the returned
   value.

</Spoiler>

6. [House Of Primes](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/6.html). Create an input box, a
   button, and h1 element. When the user types in a number and hits start
   button, all the prime numbers from 2 to the input number will be displayed.

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Create a helper function named `isPrime` that takes in a number as a
   parameter and returns a boolean: if the number is prime.
2. Create another helper function named `printAllPrimes` that takes in a number
   as a parameter and returns a string of all prime numbers from 2 to the
   number:

   ```jsx
   printAllPrimes(7)
   // returns "2...3...5...7..."
   ```

3. In your HTML code, create an Input box, start button and h1 tag.
4. Finally, when the user clicks on the start button, run the second helper
   function `printAllPrimes` with the input box value (turn it into a number) as
   argument
5. Set the returned value into `h1` element's `innerText`.

</Spoiler>

- **[Part 2](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/6b.html)**: Display each number in its
  own h1 element.

<Spoiler name="Overview">

Now would be a good time to `git add` and `git commit` your changes so that if
you mess up, you can undo quickly and restart from here.

If you did not initialize your repository yet, run `git init` and now you will
be able to use git in that folder!

Simply change the `printAllPrimes` function to return a different string:

```jsx
printAllPrimes(7)
// returns "<h1>2</h1><h1>3</h1><h1>5</h1><h1>7</h1>"
```

Change the `h1` element to a `div` element instead

Change `innerText` to `innerHTML`

</Spoiler>

7. [Delayed typing](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/7.html). Create an input box and
   a button. When the button is clicked, display each key that was typed after a
   delay of 200ms.

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Create an `h1` `input`, and `button` tag. Select them.
2. Write a function that takes in 1 arguments: a string.

   ```jsx
   type('hello')
   // Will put into h1 element:
   /*
   ...200ms...
   h
   ...200ms...
   he
   ...200ms...
   hel
   ...200ms...
   hell
   ...200ms...
   hello
   */
   ```

3. When user clicks on the button, now you can run your amazing function! Run
   the `type` function (above) and pass in the input value as an argument

   ```jsx
   button.onclick = () => {
     type(input.value)
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

- **[Part 2](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/7b.html)**: Add the new text that was
  typed to the top of the page. (type a few times)

  If you are stuck and want to solve this by yourself without looking at the
  solution, try doing the **Chat Input** exercise under **Optional Additional
  Exercises** below.

<Spoiler name = "Hint 1: What display elements do you need?">

You need two display elements: an `h1` element to display the typing, and a
`div` element to hold all of the typed strings.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name = "Hint 2: How to display the previous inputs">

When the typing is done (which should be your base case), you must clear the
`h1` element and then set the `div` element's `innerHTML` to its existing value
**plus** the string (enclosed inside a `h1` tag) that just completed in the
timeouts.

```jsx
if (i === str.length) {
  // str is the user's input
  h1Element.innerText = ''
  allMessages.innerHTML = `${allMessages.innerHTML} <h1>${str}</h1>`
  return
}
```

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Add a h1 tag, get the element
2. At the end of the `type` function above, add the string into the h1 element.

   ```jsx
   // allMessages is the h1 element from the previous step
   type = (str, i=0) => {
     if (i === str.length) {
       ...
       allMessages.innerHTML = allMessages.innerHTML + '<h1>' + str + '</h1>'
       return
     }
     ....
   }
   ```

8. [Stopwatch](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/8.html) (every 10 milliseconds)

   1. The JavaScript Math.floor() method rounds a number DOWNWARDS to the
      nearest integer, and returns the result. For example:

      ```jsx
      let num = Math.floor(3 / 2)
      // num is 1, because 3 divided by 2 is 1.5.
      //     Rounding down will give you 1.

      num = Math.floor(7 / 2) // num is 3
      num = Math.floor(9 / 4) // num is 2

      // if the number is negative,
      // rounding down will give you the next smaller negative integer
      num = Math.floor(-2.1) // num is -3
      ```

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. We need an h1 and a button element. Select them.
2. We need a variable `timeVal` to keep track of how much time has passed. The
   initial value of timeVal is 0.
3. We need a variable `isRunning` to keep track of whether the timer has started
   or not. The initial value of isRunning is `false`.
4. We need a function (named display) that takes in a number and returns a
   string that displays the second and millisecond. There are 1000ms in a
   second.

   ```jsx
   display(2000) // return "02:00"
   display(28000) // return "28:00"
   display(28290) // return "28:29"
   ```

   If you are struggling to write the `display` function, try to break it down:

   - Are you able to figure out how to return just the seconds?
   - Are you able to figure out how to return just the milliseconds?
     - If given `28290` , you may need to get out `290` .
     - To extract the last 3 numbers from a number, you use `%` remainder.
     - `28290 % 1000` will give you `290`
     - Get `29` from `290` (hundredths of a second)
     - Trouble with the math? Make sure you take the time to review
       [these math exercises](/docs/numbers)!

5. We need a helper function `setTimer` that will call setTimeout with 2
   arguments, a function and 100 (because we want to update the clock every 100
   ms). The callback function should:

   - Update `timeVal` with `timeVal + 10`
   - run `display` function and pass in `timeVal` as argument.
   - set `h1` element's innerText to the result of the `display` function.
   - call `setTimer`

   To test this step, run `setTimer` function and refresh your page. You should
   see the timer increase second by second.

6. When you click on start button, the `onclick` event function should do this:
   - Check if `isRunning` is true. If it is, return.
   - Set `isRunning` to true
   - run `setTimer` function.

</Spoiler>

- **[Part 2](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/8b.html)**: Add Pause and Stop buttons

<Spoiler name="Overview">

Make sure you test each button to check that it is working before moving on!

Add 2 button (Pause & Stop) elements and select them.

1. Pause button — the onclick event function will:

   if `isRunning` is true, set `isRunning` to false and set button text to
   Unpause.

   Otherwise, set `isRunning` to true and button text to Pause and run the
   `setTimer` function

2. Stop button — the onclick event function will:

   Set `isRunning` to false and `timeVal` to 0

3. `setTimer` function — Add codes:

   if we are stopped or paused, (`isRunning` is false), return from the function
   and don't do anything.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name="Debrief">

How did you do? Stopwatch was definitely the most complex program we've built so
far, so don't worry if you had to use mulitple hints! Good software engineers
don't hesitate to ask for help when they need it.

As you might have expected, the basic structure for the JavaScript on this page
revolves around the `onClick` event functions of each of the three buttons:
Start, Pause/Unpause, and Stop. But one key variable that ties them all together
is the `isRunning` flag. This has to be defined early on in the script and
checked whenever a button is clicked so the setTimeout functions don't go out of
control! If you want to see time fly by, remove the isRunning checks from your
solution and press Start a few times.

**Possible variants**

The more complex the problem, the more ways there are to solve it. For example,
you might have kept two separate counters, one for seconds and one for
hundredths of a second, and thus avoided using `Math.floor`, or you might have
wrapped the `isRunning` and `isPaused` flags into one. These variants are fine
as long as your stopwatch functions exactly the same as the solution page.

9. [Blinker](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/9.html): Flashing text website that
   allows users to change both the text and the speed.

<Spoiler name="Overview">

1. Add two input boxes, one for text and a numeric input box for speed of
   blinking, and a tag (named p) for displaying the text. Select them
2. Add a helper function named `blink` . This function will run:
   - if the `p` element has `innerText` value, reset it to ''
   - otherwise, set `p` element to display the text input's value
   - determine the wait time: divide 1000 by numeric input's value
   - make sure to convert input's value to a number!
   - then run `blink` again.
3. Run `blink` function
