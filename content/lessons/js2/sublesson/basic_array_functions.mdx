# Introduction

So far, you have used variables to store singular values: a number, a boolean, a
string, or even a function. But what if you want to store multiple values in a
variable (e.g. 3 numbers, 5 strings, 2 numbers and 3 strings, etc.)? We can
accomplish this with **arrays**.

An array is like a locker room. Each locker has a number, starting with 0. You
can put anything into a locker. The locker number is called an `index`, and each
locker is called an `element` (same name as a html element, but for different
purposes/usage). The value of the element is the contents of the locker.

Please note that arrays in JavaScript are zero-based which means that JavaScript
starts counting from zero when it indexes an array. The first element in an
array has an index value of zero.

The following examples will show you how to create an array and access its data.

```jsx
const trees = ['pine', 4, 'apple', 6, false, () => {}] // Example of an array.
let res = trees[0] // trees[0] refers to the element at index 0 in array trees,
// and the value of that element (which is "pine") is assigned
// to the variable res.

trees[4] = trees[0] + trees[2] // what is trees?
trees[5] = trees[1] + trees[3] // what is trees?

res = trees.length // res is 6. (total 6 elements)
// Like strings, arrays also have a special property called length.
```

_You may notice that we are declaring the variable `trees` using `const`. This
is intentional and it is not an error. The reason will be explained later in
this chapter._

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const trees = ['pine', 4, 'apple', 6, false, () => {}] // Example of an array.
let res = trees[0] // trees[0] will get the element at index 0, which is "pine"

trees[4] = trees[0] + trees[2] // ["pine", 4, "apple", 6, "pineapple", () => {}]
trees[5] = trees[1] + trees[3] // ["pine", 4, "apple", 6, "pineapple", 10]
```

Question from students:

- trees went from

  `["pine", 4, "apple", 6, false, ()=>{}]` to

  `["pine", 4, "apple", 6, "pineapple", () => {}]`.

  What happens to the false (element at index 4)?

  - `=` means left side takes the value of the right side. In other words,
    assign the value of the right side to the left side.

  ```jsx
  a = 10
  a = 20
  // a is 20 because it took the value 20
  // in tech terms: assign 20 to variable a.
  ```

  `trees[4] = 20` reads like this:

  the element at index 4 in array `trees` (left side) takes the value of 20
  (right side)

Arrays can store any data, including other arrays and functions. Try to work
through the comment questions in the below examples. They may look strange, but
if you leverage the knowledge you already have, you should be able to work out
the answers.

```jsx
const barks = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 3, 4],
  [3, 4, 5]
]
barks[2][1] = 10 // what is barks?
barks[1][0] = barks[2][1] // what is barks?

barks[2] = () => {
  barks[0][1] = barks[0][1] + barks[0][0]
}
// what is barks?
barks[2]() // what is barks[2]()?
barks[1] = barks[2]()
// In the end, what is barks?

// fyi, barks is a 2-dimensional array
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const barks = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 3, 4],
  [3, 4, 5]
]
barks[2][1] = 10 // [[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,10,5]]
/*
The computer reads from left to right.
fyi: barks is a 2-dimensional array
barks[2] is the element at index 2 which has a value of array [3,4,5]
barks[2] refers to the 1st dimension and the element at index 2 which
is [3,4,5]
barks[2][1] -- [2] refers to the 1st dimension, 
       whereas [1] refers to the 2nd dimension.
barks[2][1] means 
  element at index 2 of 1st dimension and index 1 of 2nd dimension
  which has a value of 4
  const barks = [[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,***4***,5]]
                 barks[0] barks[1] barks[2]  barks[2][1] has value of ***4***                

So barks[2][1] = 10
    means element at index 1 in array [3,***4***,5] takes the value 10
*/

barks[1][0] = barks[2][1] // [[1,2,3], [10,3,4], [3,10,5]]
//                                       ^           ^
//                                   barks[1][0] barks[2][1]

barks[2] = () => {
  barks[0][1] = barks[0][1] + barks[0][0]
}
// the element at barks[2] has been replaced by a function
// barks now has [[1,3,3], [10,3,4], function]
barks[2]() // barks[2]() is undefined
barks[1] = barks[2]()
// barks now has [[1,4,3], undefined, function]
```

A string stores a series of characters like: comment = "The dog barks", whereas
an array can store multiple values under the same variable name like: fruits =
["apples", "oranges", "pears"]

They are 2 different data types. Because of the way the underlying data is
stored, there are things you can do to an array that you can't do to a string,
and vice-versa.

## Exercises

1. Create an array with 3 identical strings.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const a = ['Thor', 'Thor', 'Thor']
```

</Spoiler>

2. Create an array with 3 functions.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const b = [() => {}, () => {}, () => {}]
```

</Spoiler>

3. Create an array with a string, a function, and an array.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const c = ['Peter', () => {}, [19, 'Quill']]
```

</Spoiler>

4. Write a function named `solution` that takes in an array as a parameter and
   returns a function. When the returned function is called, the array input is
   returned.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = input => {
  return () => {
    return input
  }
}
```

# Non-Primitive Data Types

In JS0 you learned that numbers, strings, and booleans are primitive data types.
The value of a primitive data type variable can only contain a single thing (be
it a string or a number or whatever).

```jsx
// Primitive data types are known as being immutable data types
// because there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created.
let string1 = 'This is a string.'
string1[1] = 'X'
console.log(string1) * //* string1 still has 'This is a string.'
// value of string1 cannot be changed
string1 = 'xyz'
console.log(string1) // string1 now has 'xyz'
// value of string1 has been totally replaced by 'xyz'
// here, a new copy of string1 is created with value 'xyz'
// and variable string1 gets reassigned to a new reference
```

All other data types are non-primitive data type.

For example, array is a non-primitive data type.

What this means is that when you assign an array to a variable, the variable
stores an address (also known as a reference) to the actual array data, not the
array data itself.

This concept actually exists in real life for the same reasons.

- (primitive) - When someone gives you cash, you get the money itself.
- (non-primitive) - When someone sells you their house, you get a deed with your
  name and the address of the house on it, and you also get the keys to the
  house. The deed states that you are the owner of the actual house.

In real life, we use addresses when dealing with houses because they are not
easily portable. Similarly, addresses are needed for non-primitive data types
because they tend to be large and therefore cannot move around easily. At work,
it is very common for software engineers to work with arrays with thousands of
elements.

Let's walk through a few examples.

```jsx
const a = [1, 2, 3]
const b = [
  false,
  'spiderman',
  (a, b) => {
    return a - b
  }
]
```

Let's dissect (step by step) what the computer would do when it sees the code
above:

- Line 1 `=` means that `a` is.... (need to figure out the right side)
  - The computer sees `[1,2,3]`, so it goes into its memory and finds an empty
    place to store the data.
  - After the computer finds and stores the data, it no longer needs to keep
    track of the array. It simply keeps track of the location (address) of the
    data.
  - `a` contains the address or reference of the array.
- Line 2
  - `=` means that `b` is.... (need to figure out the right side)
    - The computer sees `[false,"spiderman",(a,b)=>{return a-b}]`, so it goes
      into its memory and finds an empty place to store the data. Note that this
      will be a different size space than the space used to store `a`.
    - After the computer finds and stores the data, it no longer needs to keep
      track of the array. It simply keeps track of the location (address) of the
      data.
    - `b` contains the address or reference of the array.

Note: In the above example, `a` and `b` have different addresses.

```jsx
const a = [1, 2, 3]
const b = [1, 2, 3]

const c = a === b // what is c?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const a = [1, 2, 3]
const b = [1, 2, 3]

const c = a === b // false, because a and b have different addresses
// although they have the same content
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const a = [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3] // what is a?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const a = [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3] // still false!
// the computer is creating 2 arrays and they have different addresses
```

</Spoiler>

## Variable Declarations

```jsx
const musicians = [1, 2, 3, 4] // Since arrays are non-primitive data,
// musicians contains the address to the musicians array data.

musicians[0] = 'Mozart' // did the variable musicians change?
musicians[1] = 'Beethoven' // did the variable musicians change?
musicians[2] = 'Liszt' // did the variable musicians change?
musicians[3] = 'Chopin' // did the variable musicians change?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const musicians = [1, 2, 3, 4] // Since arrays are non-primitive data,
// musicians is an address to the array data.

musicians[0] = 'Mozart' // no
musicians[1] = 'Beethoven' // no
musicians[2] = 'Liszt' // no
musicians[3] = 'Chopin' // no

// The data changed, but `musicians` itself contains an address.
// The address stayed the same.
```

</Spoiler>

> For all non-primitive data, you should **always** declare them with a `const`
> because their address does not change.

When declaring non-primitive variables, only use `let` when you plan to reuse
the variable to store other addresses. For example:

```jsx
let musicians = ['Mozart', 'Beethoven']
musicians = ['Liszt', 'Chopin']
// musicians variable now holds a completely new address for a completely different array.
```

## Variable Assignments

In many cases, software engineers introduce bugs into their codebase because
they did not pay attention to the nature of non-primitive data types. The
following examples will help you understand why you should be careful when
working with non-primitive data.

```jsx
const avengers = ['Banner', 'Stark', 'Odinson', 'Rogers']
const team = avengers
avengers[1] = 'Fury'
// what is avengers?
// what is team?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const avengers = ['Banner', 'Stark', 'Odinson', 'Rogers']
const team = avengers
avengers[1] = 'Fury'
// both avengers and team contain the same address or reference,
// so they both have the same values
// ["Banner", "Fury", "Odinson", "Rogers"]
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const guardians = ['Rocket', 2, 'Drax']
const milano = guardians
milano[milano[1]] = 'Quill'
// What is guardians?
// What is milano?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const guardians = ['Rocket', 2, 'Drax']
const milano = guardians
milano[milano[1]] = 'Quill' // This is equivalent to: milano[2] = "Quill"
// guardians and milano contain the same address,
// so they both have the value
// ["Rocket", 2, "Quill"]
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const planets = ['Morag', 'Aakon', 'Xandar']
const worlds = planets
worlds[2] = planets
worlds[2][1] = 'Ego' // What is worlds?
// What is planets?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const planets = ['Morag', 'Aakon', 'Xandar']
const worlds = planets // both worlds and planets have the same address
// to the same arrary
worlds[2] = planets // worlds[2] now stores the address to itself:
// ["Morag", "Aakon", worlds]
worlds[2][1] = 'Ego'
// worlds[2] is the address to worlds itself,
// which is the same address as planets
// Therefore, it's no different from writing planets[1] = "Ego"
// or worlds[1] = "Ego"
// both planets and worlds have:
// ["Morag", "Ego", worlds]
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
const planets = ['Morag', 'Aakon', 'Xandar']
let worlds = planets
worlds = ['Earth', 'Contraxia', 'Berhart']
// what is worlds?
// what is planets?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const planets = ['Morag', 'Aakon', 'Xandar']
let worlds = planets // worlds now has the same address as planets
worlds = ['Earth', 'Contraxia', 'Berhart'] // worlds is the address of a
// new array
// worlds: ["Earth", "Contraxia", "Berhart"]
// planets: ["Morag", "Aakon", "Xandar"]
```

## Functions

We've seen several examples of how making assignments when working with
non-primitive data can affect multiple variables. Our last example will look at
what happens when an array is passed into a function. Run through the function
like a computer would and figure out what's happening to each variable.

```jsx
const fruitPrices = [100, 150, 200]
const addTax = (arr, i = 0) => {
  if (i === arr.length) {
    return arr
  }
  arr[i] = arr[i] * 1.1
  return addTax(arr, i + 1)
}
const cost = addTax(fruitPrices) // what is cost?
// what is fruitPrices?

const isSame = fruitPrices === cost // what is isSame?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fruitPrices = [100, 150, 200] // This is the only array that gets
// created in this code snippet!
const addTax = (arr, i = 0) => {
  if (i === arr.length) {
    return arr
  }
  arr[i] = arr[i] * 1.1
  return addTax(arr, i + 1)
}
const cost = addTax(fruitPrices) // [110, 165, 220]
// fruitPrices is also [110, 165, 220] because they are the same array

const isSame = fruitPrices === cost // true, because they are the same array
```

## Exercises

To keep your solutions organized, you can create a new file for this section
(such as `non-primitive.js`) and a new test file (such as
`non-primitive.test.js`). Refer back to Preflight if you need a refresher on the
steps.

1. Write a function named `selectiveZero` that takes in an array and a number.
   This function replaces the value of any elements of an array when the
   element's value matches the given number with a value of 0.

   ```jsx
   selectiveZero([5, 2, 2, 9], 2) // [5,0,0,9]
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('selectiveZero function', () => {
     it('should change multiple instances of the input number to 0', () => {
       const arr = [5, 2, 2, 9]
       fn.selectiveZero(arr, 2)
       expect(arr).toEqual([5, 0, 0, 9])
     })
     it('should return an empty array', () => {
       const arr = []
       const result = fn.selectiveZero(arr, 3)
       expect(result).toEqual(arr)
     })
     it('should not modify an array with no matches', () => {
       const arr = [8, 9, 1, "I'm a string"]
       const original = [...arr]
       fn.selectiveZero(arr, 6)
       expect(arr).toEqual(original)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const selectiveZero = (arr, val) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - You are given an array `arr` and a number `val`.
   - We need additional variable (let's say `i` ) to track index of an array
     which starts at 0.
   - When index `i` equals the length of array `arr`,
     - return `arr`.
   - When array `arr` at index `i` equals `val`,
     - update `arr` at that index `i` to equal 0.
   - Continue.

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const selectiveZero = (arr, val, i = 0) => {
     if (i === arr.length) {
       return arr
     }
     if (arr[i] === val) {
       arr[i] = 0
     }
     return selectiveZero(arr, val, i + 1)
   }
   ```

2. Write a function named `largest` that returns the largest number in an array.

   ```jsx
   largest([5, 3, 9]) // 9
   largest([-20, -2, -5, -10]) // -2
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('largest function', () => {
     it('should find the largest of 3 numbers', () => {
       const result = fn.largest([5, 3, 9])
       expect(result).toEqual(9)
     })
     it('should find the largest of 4 negative numbers', () => {
       const result = fn.largest([-20, -2, -5, -10])
       expect(result).toEqual(-2)
     })
     it('should return undefined on an empty array', () => {
       expect(fn.largest([])).toEqual(undefined)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const largest = arr => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr` .
   - We need additional variable (let's say `i` ) to track index of the array
     which starts at 0.
   - We need additional variable (let's say `currentLargest` ) to keep track of
     which values are largest at a given index which start at first index of
     `arr`.
   - When `i` equals the length of `arr`,
     - return `currentLargest`.
   - When the value of the element at index of `i` of array `arr` is greater
     than `currentLargest`,
     - Update `currentLargest` to the value of the element in array `arr` at
       index `i`.
   - Continue.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const largest = (arr, i = 0, currentLargest = arr[0]) => {
     if (i === arr.length) {
       return currentLargest
     }
     if (arr[i] > currentLargest) {
       currentLargest = arr[i]
     }
     return largest(arr, i + 1, currentLargest)
   }
   ```

3. Write a function named `firstXToZero` that sets the value of the first X
   elements in an array to 0, where X is the input number.

   ```jsx
   firstXToZero([0, 5, 9, 6], 3) // [0,0,0,6]
   firstXToZero([1, 5, 4, 3, 3], 2) // [0,0,4,3,3]
   firstXToZero([1, 5, 9, 6], 1) // [0,5,9,6]

       expect(result).toEqual([0, 0, 0, 6])
     })
     it('should not modify the array when changing 0 elements', () => {
       const result = fn.firstXToZero(["Don't", 'change', 'me'], 0)
       expect(result).toEqual(["Don't", 'change', 'me'])
     })
     it('should change all to zero when X beyond array length', () => {
       const result = fn.firstXToZero([1, 2, 3], 4)
       expect(result).toEqual([0, 0, 0])
     })
   })
   ```

   ```jsx
   const firstXtoZero = (arr, firstX) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr` and a number `firstX`.
   - We need additional variable (let's say `i` ) to track index of an array
     which starts at 0.
   - When index `i` equals the length of the array `arr`,
     - return array `arr`.
   - When index `i` is greater than or equal to number `firstX`,
     - return array `arr`.
   - Update the value of element at index `i` in array `arr` to 0.
   - Continue.
4. **Code**

     }
     arr[i] = 0
     return firstXToZero(arr, firstX, i + 1)

4. Write a function named `allPrime` that determines whether the value of every
   element in an array is a prime number.

   ```jsx
   allPrime([2, 7, 9, 10]) // false, because 10 (2*5) is not prime
   allPrime([19, 13, 17, 11]) // true
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('allPrime function', () => {

       const result = fn.allPrime([2, 3, 17, 19])
       expect(result).toEqual(true)
     })
     it('should return false for an array with some primes', () => {
       const result = fn.allPrime([0, 7, 11, 12])
       expect(result).toEqual(false)
     })
     it('should return true for an empty array', () => {
       const result = fn.allPrime([])
       expect(result).toEqual(true)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const allPrime = arr => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr`.
   - We need additional variable (let's say `i` ) to track index of an array
     which starts at 0.
   - We need helper function `isPrime` to help us determine which element's
     value is prime in the given array `arr`.
   - When index `i` equals the length of array `arr`,
     - return true.
   - When the value of element at index `i` in array `arr` is not prime,
     - return false.
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const isPrime = (num, i = 2) => {
     if (num < i) return false
     if (num === i) return true
     if (num % i === 0) return false
     return isPrime(n, i + 1)
   }

   const allPrime = (arr, i = 0) => {
     if (i === arr.length) {
       return true
     }
     if (!isPrime(arr[i])) return false
     return allPrime(arr, i + 1)
   }
   ```

5. Write a function named `increasing` that determines whether the elements of
   an array are ordered such that they represent a strictly ascending sequence
   of numbers. This means that the value of each element (other than the first)
   is greater than the value of the previous element.

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

This time you might not want to start your index counter at 0. Just remember if
the array only has one element, your function should return true.

</Spoiler>

```jsx
increasing([2, 7, 9, 10]) // true
increasing([19, 13, 17, 11]) // false, because 19 -> 13 is decreasing
increasing([2, 7, 7, 10]) // false. 7 -> 7 is technically not increasing
```

<Spoiler>

If you are asked this question during an interview, make sure to check with the
interviewer what should happen if the input is an empty array! In this case, we
choose to return true for empty arrays for convenience.

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('increasing function', () => {
     it('should return true for an increasing array', () => {
       const result = fn.increasing([2, 7, 9, 10])
       expect(result).toEqual(true)
     })
     it('should return false for an array that decreases', () => {
       const result = fn.increasing([19, 13, 17, 11])
       expect(result).toEqual(false)
     })
     it('should return false if elements are repeated', () => {
       const result = fn.increasing([2, 7, 7, 10])
       expect(result).toEqual(false)
     })
     it('should return true for an array of one number', () => {
       const result = fn.increasing([51])
       expect(result).toEqual(true)
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const increasing = arr => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `arr`.
   - We need additional variable (let's say `i` ) to track index of an array
     which starts at 0.
   - When the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array
     `arr`,
     - return true.
   - When the value of element at index `i` in array `arr` is less than or equal
     to the value of the element at previous index `i - 1` in array `arr`
     - return false.
   - Continue.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const increasing = (arr, i = 1) => {
     if (i >= arr.length) {
       return true
     }
     if (arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]) return false
     return increasing(arr, i + 1)
   }

# Basic Array Functions

Now that you know how to create arrays and change the data inside the array,
this section will show you the functions you need to run in order to add and
remove data from an array.

## Push()

The Push() method takes one or more elements as arguments and adds them to the
end of an array. Push() returns the new length of the array.

```jsx
const apples = ['Fuji', 'Gala']
const trees = apples.push('Pink Lady', 'Washington')
// apples is now ["Fuji", "Gala", "Pink Lady", "Washington"] because push adds
// to the array apples, trees now contains the new length of the array (4)

const peaches = [4, 8, 12]
const plums = peaches
peaches.push(plums)
// What is peaches?
// What is plums?

plums[0] = 47
// what is peaches?
// what is plums?

peaches[3][1] = 39
// what is peaches?
// what is plums?

let nectarines = [1, 2, 3]
nectarines = nectarines.push(6)
// what is nectarines?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const apples = ['Fuji', 'Gala']
const trees = apples.push('Pink Lady', 'Washington')
// apples is now ["Fuji", "Gala", "Pink Lady", "Washington"]
// because push adds to the array
// trees contains the new length of the array (4)

const peaches = [4, 8, 12]
const plums = peaches
peaches.push(plums)
// peaches and plums refer the same array (same address) and they are both have:
// [4, 8, 12, array]
//    Note: [4, 8, 12, peaches] or [4,8,12,plums] are also both correct answers.
//    we used array here to represent all of the possible answers:
//    [4, 8, 12, peaches]
//    [4, 8, 12, plums]
//    [4, 8, 12, peaches[3]]
//    [4, 8, 12, plums[3]]
//    [4, 8, 12, plums[3][3]]
//    [4, 8, 12, peaches[3][3]]
//    [4, 8, 12, plums[3][3][3]]
//    [4, 8, 12, peaches[3][3][3]]
//    ...

plums[0] = 47
// peaches and plums are the same array (same address) and they are both:
// [47, 8, 12, array]

peaches[3][1] = 39
// peaches and plums are the same array (same address)
// peaches[3] also has the same address so peaches[3] is the same array as peaches
// [47, 39, 12, array]

let nectarines = [1, 2, 3]
nectarines = nectarines.push(6)
// push returns the length of the new array, so nectarines is 4
```

</Spoiler>

## Pop()

Pop() method removes the last element in an array and returns the removed
element.

If the array is empty, undefined is returned.

```jsx
const states = ['Delaware', 'Missouri', 'Hawaii']
const lastState = states.pop()
// lastState is "Hawaii" and states is now ["Delaware", "Missouri"]

const nuts = ['almond', 'pistachio', 'hazelnut']
const seeds = nuts
const nutella = nuts.pop()
// What is nutella?
// What is nuts?
// What is seeds?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const states = ['Delaware', 'Missouri', 'Hawaii']
const lastState = states.pop() // "Hawaii"
// state is now ["Delaware", "Missouri"]

const nuts = ['almond', 'pistachio', 'hazelnut']
const seeds = nuts
const nutella = nuts.pop()
// nuts and seeds are the same array and they are both ["almond", "pistachio"]
// nutella is "hazelnut"
```

</Spoiler>

## Shift()

Shift() is like `pop()` but in the opposite direction. It removes the
**_first_** element in the array and returns the removed element. It returns
undefined if the array is empty.

```jsx
const states = ['Delaware', 'Missouri', 'Hawaii']
const firstState = states.shift()
// firstState is "Delaware" and states is now ["Missouri", "Hawaii"]

const nuts = ['almond', 'pistachio', 'hazelnut']
const seeds = nuts
const drupe = nuts.shift()
// What is nuts?
// What is seeds?
// What is drupe?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const states = ['Delaware', 'Missouri', 'Hawaii']
const firstState = states.shift()
// firstState is "Delaware" and states is now ["Missouri", "Hawaii"]

const nuts = ['almond', 'pistachio', 'hazelnut']
const seeds = nuts
const drupe = nuts.shift()
// nuts and seeds are the same array and they are both ["pistachio", "hazelnut"]
// drupe is "almond"
```

</Spoiler>

## Unshift()

Unshift() is like `push` but in the opposite direction. It takes in one or more
elements as arguments and adds them to the **_beginning_** of the array, and
returns the new array length.

```jsx
const nuts = ['almond', 'pistachio', 'hazelnut']
const seeds = nuts
nuts.unshift(seeds)
// What is nuts?
// What is seeds?

const states = ['Pennsylvania', 'New Jersey', 'Georgia']
const numStates = states.unshift('Delaware', 'New York')
// what is states and numStates?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const nuts = ['almond', 'pistachio', 'hazelnut']
const seeds = nuts
nuts.unshift(seeds)
// nuts and seeds are the same array (same address) and they are both:
// [array, "almond", "pistachio", "hazelnut"]

const states = ['Pennsylvania', 'New Jersey', 'Georgia']
const numStates = states.unshift('Delaware', 'New York')
// unshift returns the length of new array, so numStates is now 5
```

</Spoiler>

## Splice()

The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing
existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.

The syntax of splice() is:

let **arrDeletedItems** = **array**.splice(_`start`_[, _`deleteCount`_[,
_item1_[, _item2_[, ...]]]])

**_`start`_**

The index at which to start changing the array.

If _`start`_ is greater than the length of the array, *`start`* will be set to
the length of the array. In this case, no element will be deleted but the method
will behave as an adding function, adding as many element as item[n*] provided.

If negative, it will begin that many elements from the end of the array. (In
this case, the origin `-1`, meaning `-*n*` is the index of the *`n`*th last
element, and is therefore equivalent to the index of `array.length - *n*`.)

If `array.length + *start*` is less than `0`, it will begin from index `0`.

***`deleteCount`* | Optional**

An integer indicating the number of elements in the array to remove
from *`start`*.

If *`deleteCount`* is omitted, or if its value is equal to or larger
than `array.length - *start*` (that is, if it is equal to or greater than the
number of elements left in the array, starting at *`start`*), then all the
elements from *`start`* to the end of the array will be deleted.

**Note:** In IE8, it won't delete all when *`deleteCount`* is omitted.

If *`deleteCount`* is `0` or negative, no elements are removed. In this case,
you should specify at least one new element (see below).

**_`item1_, *item2*, ...`  | Optional**

The elements to be added to the array, beginning from index *`start`*. If you do
not specify any elements, `splice()` will only remove elements from the array.

**Return value**

An array containing the deleted elements.

If only one element is removed, an array of one element is returned.

If no elements are removed, an empty array is returned.

Let's see some examples:

```jsx
const fruits = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango']
let removed = fruits.splice(2, 1, 'Lemon', 'Kiwi')
// First, 1 element is removed starting at index 2, so fruits becomes
//    ["Banana", "Orange", "Mango"]
// Next, the rest of the parameters are added in at index 2
// Result: ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Kiwi", "Mango"]

const fruits2 = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango']
removed = fruits2.splice(2, 2) // what is fruits2?

removed = fruits2.splice(0, 1, 'Apple', 'Mango', 'Pear')
// what is fruits2 and removed?

removed = fruits2.splice(-2, 1) // what is fruits2 and removed?

removed = fruits2.splice(1) // what is fruits2 and removed?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const fruits = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango']
let removed = fruits.splice(2, 1, 'Lemon', 'Kiwi')
// First, 1 element is removed starting at index 2,
//        so fruits becomes ["Banana", "Orange", "Mango"]
// Next, the rest of the parameters are added in at index 2
// fruits  has ["Banana", "Orange", **"Lemon", "Kiwi",** "Mango"]
// removed has ["Apple"]

const fruits2 = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango']
removed = fruits2.splice(2, 2)
// remove 2 elements starting at index 2 ("Apple", "Mango")
// fruits2 has ["Banana", "Orange"] (we didn't add anything)
// removed has ["Apple", "Mango"]

removed = fruits2.splice(0, 1, 'Apple', 'Mango', 'Pear')
// fruits2 was ["**Banana**", "Orange"]
// "Banana" at index 0 was removed,
// and "Apple", "Mango", "Pear" added at its place (index 0)
// fruits2 has ["Apple", "Mango", "Pear", "Orange"]
// removed has ["Banana"]

removed = fruits2.splice(-2, 1)
// fruits2 was ["Apple", "Mango", "**Pear**", "Orange"]
// remove 1 element, 2nd element from end which is "Pear"
// fruits2 has ["Apple", "Mango", "Orange"]
// removed has ["Pear"]

removed = fruits2.splice(1)
// fruits2 was ["Apple", "Mango", "Orange"]
// remove all element from index 1 onwards ("Mango", "Orange" removed)
// fruits2 has ["Apple"]
// removed has ["Mango", "Orange"]

## Exercises

1. Write a function named `copyArray` that takes in an array and returns a **new
   array** that is an identical copy of the given array.

   ```jsx
   copyArray(['Rocket', 'Groot', 'Star-Lord']) // ["Rocket", "Groot", "Star-Lord"]
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('copyArray function', () => {
     it('should copy an array of 3 elements', () => {
       const result = fn.copyArray([-5, -23, 'study'])
       expect(result).toEqual([-5, -23, 'study'])
     })
     it('should not modify original array', () => {
       const original = [
         'hi',
         1,
         () => {
           return 5
         },
         'apple',
         45
       ]
       const result = fn.copyArray(original)
       original[0] = 'Drax'
       expect(result[0]).toEqual('hi')
     })
     it('should copy an empty array', () => {
       const result = fn.copyArray([])
       expect(result).toEqual([])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const copyArray = a => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - You are given an array `a`.
   - We will need another variable (let's say it is `result` ) to store the copy
     of the array and it starts at an empty array.
   - When the length of array `result` equals the length of array `a`,
     - return `result`.
   - Use the `push()` method with array `result` to push in the elements from
     array `a` .

     - Push all the elements from `a` to `result`.

     > The `push()` method takes one or more elements as arguments and adds them
     > to the end of an array. `Push()` returns the new length of the array.

   - Continue.

</Spoiler>

2. Write a function named `removeElement` that takes in an array `a` and a
   string as parameters. This function removes any element of the array `a` when
   the element's value matches the value of the string. On completion, returns
   the updated array `a`.

   ```jsx
   const a = ['Rocket', 'Groot', 'Groot', 'Star-Lord']
   const b = removeElement(a, 'Groot') // ["Rocket", "Star-Lord"]
   const c = b === a // since removeElement returns the original array,
   // b === a should be true
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

We haven't worked on removing array elements directly yet, but we did learn a
function that can do the trick if you don't have any optional arguments...

</Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('remove function', () => {
     it('should not remove anything', () => {
       const data = ['Rocket', 'Groot', 'Star-Lord']
       const result = fn.removeElement(data, 'Random')
       expect(result).toEqual(['Rocket', 'Groot', 'Star-Lord'])
     })
     it('should remove 1 element', () => {
       const data = ['Rocket', 'Groot', 'Star-Lord']
       const result = fn.removeElement(data, 'Star-Lord')
       expect(result).toEqual(['Rocket', 'Groot'])
     })
     it('should remove all elements', () => {
       const data = ['Rocket', 'Rocket', 'Rocket']

     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const removeElement = (a, val) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - You are given an array `a` and a string `val`.
   - We need another variable (let's call it `i`) to keep track of index in
     array `a`. The index starts at 0.
   - When index `i` equals to the length of the array `a`,
     - return array `a`.
   - When the value of the element at index `i` in array `a` equals to the value
     of `val`, use `splice` to remove the element at index `i` in array `a` and
     then call `removeElement` function for the next element.

     > The `splice()` method changes the contents of an array by removing or
     > replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.

   - Continue.

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const removeElement = (a, val, i = 0) => {
     if (i === a.length) {
       return a
     }
     if (a[i] === val) {
       a.splice(i, 1)
       return removeElement(a, val, i) // Should not do i+1
       // because array just became smaller
     }
     return removeElement(a, val, i + 1)
   }
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

How is this different from the first exercise? Here we're not creating any new
array, but rather modifying an existing one. So our recursive function only has
to pass the address of the original array each time it's called.

In fact, because the function modifies its input, we could ignore the return
value or not return anything at all. Changing the base case from `return a` to
simply `return` and calling it with `removeElement(a, "Groot")` with no return
variable would still modify `a`.

3. Write a function named `copyWithout` that takes in an array and a number and
   returns a copied array. This function copies all elements in the array except
   for elements whose value matches the given number. On completion, returns the
   copied array.

     })
     it('should not modify original array', () => {
       const arr = [5, 2, 2, 9]
       fn.copyWithout(arr, 2)
       expect(arr).toEqual([5, 2, 2, 9])
     })
     it('should copy without last 2 elements', () => {
       const result = fn.copyWithout([2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 3)
       expect(result).toEqual([2, 2, 2])
     })
     it('should return identical array if no matches', () => {
       const result = fn.copyWithout([2, 6, 4], 3)
       expect(result).toEqual([2, 6, 4])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const copyWithout = (a, val) => {}

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `a` and a string `val`.
   - We need another variable (let's say it is `i`) to keep track of index in
     array `a` . The index starts at 0.
   - We need another array variable (let's say it is `result`) and it starts
     with empty array
   - When index `i` equals to the length of the array `a`,
     - return `result` .
   - When value of element at index `i` in array `a` is not equal to string
     `val`,
     - Push the element at index `i` in array `a` into the array `result` .
   - Continue with the next element in array `a` .
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const copyWithout = (a, val, i = 0, result = []) => {
     if (i === a.length) {
       return result
     }
     if (a[i] !== val) {

4. Write a function named `copyReverse` that makes a copy of an array in the
   reverse order.

     it('should reverse copy an array of 1 element', () => {
       const result = fn.copyReverse(['bears'])
       expect(result).toEqual(['bears'])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const copyReverse = a => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - You are given an array `a`.
   - We need a variable (let's say it is `result`) to store a copy of array `a`
     backwards and it starts as an empty array.
   - When the length of array `result` equals length of array `a` ,
     - return `result`.
   - Use `unshift` method to copy all the elements of array `a` to an empty
     array `result` in reverse order. That is, start copying from the first
     element of array `a` to the beginning of array `result` , then copy the 2nd
     element of array `a` to the beginning of array `result` until all elements
     of array `a` have been copied.

     > The `unshift()` method takes in one or more elements as arguments and
     > adds them to the **_beginning_** of the array, and returns the new array
     > length.

   - Continue

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const copyReverse = (a, result = []) => {
     if (result.length === a.length) {

     result.unshift(a[result.length])
     return copyReverse(a, result)

5. Write a function named `copyLast` that copies an array but leaves out a given
   number of elements at the front.

   copyLast(['Ironman', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'Black Widow', 'Hulk'], 2)
   // ["Captain", "Black Widow", "Hulk"]

       const result = fn.copyLast(heroes, 2)
       expect(result).toEqual(['Captain', 'Black Widow', 'Hulk'])
     })
     it('should not modify original array', () => {
       fn.copyLast(heroes, 2)
       expect(heroes).toEqual(original)
     })
     it('should skip the first 0 elements (copy whole array)', () => {
       const result = fn.copyLast(heroes, 0)
       expect(result).toEqual(heroes)
     })
     it('should return empty array if skipping past array length', () => {
       const result = fn.copyLast(heroes, 6)
       expect(result).toEqual([])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const copyLast = (a, b) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - You are given an array `a` and a number `b` as the inputs.
   - We need another variable (let's say `result` ) to store the new array which
     starts with an empty array "".
   - We need another variable (let's say it is `i`) to keep track of index in
     array `a` and it starts at 0
   - When index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of array `a`,

     - return `result`

   - When index `i` is greater than or equal to `b`,

     - get the element at index `i` in array `a`, and then `push` it into
       `result`.

     > The `push()` method takes one or more arguments and adds them to the end
     > of the array. `Push()` returns the new length of the array.

   - Continue

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const copyLast = (a, b, result = [], i = 0) => {
     if (i >= a.length) {
       return result
     }
     if (i >= b) {
       result.push(a[i])
     }
     return copyLast(a, b, result, i + 1)
   }
   ```

<Spoiler name="Debrief">

We've been asked to skip the first certain number of elements in the array, so
one easy way to do it is to start at the beginning and check each time if we've
reached the starting point yet. We could also have set `i=b` as the default
parameter.

The alternative solution without using the index variable `i`. The pushing
starts from the value of number `b`, which is the number of elements to skip.
Since index of array starts from 0, the index of the next element to push will
be the same as the value of number `b`. The value of variable `b` will be
incremented by 1 for the next element.

```jsx
const copyLast = (a, b, result = []) => {
  if (b >= a.length) {
    return result
  }

  result.push(a[b])

  return copyLast3(a, b + 1, result)
}
```

The next exercise will challenge you to do the same type of modification, but on
the other end of the array.

       const result = fn.copyFirst(heroes, 0)
       expect(result).toEqual(heroes)
     })
     it('should return empty array if skipping past array length', () => {
       const result = fn.copyFirst(heroes, 6)
       expect(result).toEqual([])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const copyFirst = (a, b) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - You are given an array `a` and a number `b`.
   - We need an additional variable (let's say `i`) to keep track of index in
     array `a` and it starts at 0
   - We need another variable (let's say `result` ) which starts with an empty
     array "".
   - When index `i` is greater than or equal to `a.length - b` ,
     - return `result`
   - Push element at index `i` in array `a` into `result`.

   > The `push()` method takes one or more elements as arguments and adds them
   > to the end of an array. `Push()` returns the new length of the array.

   - Continue.

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const copyFirst = (a, b, result = [], i = 0) => {
     if (i >= a.length - b) {
       return result
     }
     result.push(a[i])
     return copyFirst(a, b, result, i + 1)
   }
   ```

7. Write a function named `runOnEach` that calls a function on every element in
   an array, and returns a new array with the results.

   ```jsx
   runOnEach([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (e, i) => {
     // notice the input function has 2 parameters
     return e + i
   }) // returns [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('copyWithCall function', () => {
     const heroes = ['Ironman', 'Thor', 'Captain']
     const thanos = () => {
       return 'Thanos'
     }
     it('should call a function with two arguments', () => {
       const result = fn.runOnEach([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (e, i) => {
         return e + i
       })
       expect(result).toEqual([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
     })
     it('should not modify original array', () => {
       const original = [...heroes]
       fn.runOnEach(heroes, thanos)
       expect(heroes).toEqual(original)
     })
     it('should call a function with no arguments', () => {
       const result = fn.runOnEach(heroes, thanos)
       expect(result).toEqual(['Thanos', 'Thanos', 'Thanos'])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const runOnEach = (a, fn) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are given an array `a` and a function `fn`.
   - We need another variable (let's say it is `i`) to keep track of index in
     array `a` and it starts at 0
   - We need another variable (let's say `result` ) to store the new array and
     it starts with an empty array.
   - When index `i` equals to the length of array `a`,
     - return `result`.
   - Call the input function `fn` with element at index `i` in array `a` as one
     of the arguments.
   - Another argument for input function `fn` is index `i`.
   - Push the output of calling the input function `fn` into array `result`.
   - Continue.
4. **Code**

```jsx
const runOnEach = (a, fn, i = 0, result = []) => {
  if (i === a.length) {
    return result
  }
  result.push(fn(a[i], i))
  return runOnEach(a, fn, i + 1, result)
}
```

How did you do on that one? The main difference between this and exercise 1 is
that here we're running the function on each element and its index. To work as
expected, your function had to pass both the element and the index to the `fn`
function—it's up to the called functions how many (if any) of their arguments
they use.

8. Write a function named `onlyIndex` that takes an array of arrays and returns
   an array of each array's element at a given index. (If you think of the big
   array as a table of rows, this function returns a given column).

   ```jsx
   onlyIndex(
     [
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
       [6, 9, 8, 7, 6],
       [4, 5, 6, 6, 7],
       [0, 1, 2, 3, 9]
     ],
     2
   ) // returns [ 3, 8, 6, 2 ]
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Tests**

   ```jsx
   describe('onlyIndex function', () => {
     const someNumbers = [
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
       [6, 9, 8, 7, 6],
       [4, 5, 6, 6, 7],
       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
     ]
     it('should not modify the original array', () => {
       const original = [...someNumbers]
       fn.onlyIndex(someNumbers, 2)
       expect(someNumbers).toEqual(original)
     })
     it('should pull out the element at index 2', () => {
       const result = fn.onlyIndex(someNumbers, 2)
       expect(result).toEqual([3, 8, 6, 2])
     })
     it('should pull out the element at index 0', () => {
       const result = fn.onlyIndex(someNumbers, 0)
       expect(result).toEqual([1, 6, 4, 0])
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const onlyIndex = (a, b) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - You are given an array of arrays `a` and a number `b`.
   - We need another variable (let's say it is `i`) to keep track of index in
     array `a` and it starts at 0.
   - We need another variable (let's say `result` ) to store the new array and
     it starts with an empty array "".
   - When index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of an array `a`,
     - return `result`
   - When number `b` is greater than or equal to the length of first index `i`
     of array `a`,

     - return `result`

   - Push array `a` at index `i` and number `b` into array `result`.
   - Continue.

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const onlyIndex = (a, b, i = 0, result = []) => {
     if (i >= a.length) {
       return result
     }
     if (b >= a[0].length) {
       return result
     }
     result.push(a[i][b])
     return onlyIndex(a, b, i + 1, result)
   }
   ```
