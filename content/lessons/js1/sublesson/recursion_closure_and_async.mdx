# Interviewing

During interviews for software engineering positions, your ability to write
functions will be tested. Your interviewer will not write down every detail for
you describing what the function does. Instead, they will give you a few
examples, briefly describe it, and see what you do.

Therefore, from this lesson on, all exercise problems will have short
explanations to help train your ability to figure out what you are supposed to
do from the examples. For each problem and during interviews, we highly
recommend following these 5 steps:

1. Provide 3 examples. Make sure to always use examples with negative numbers,
   0, and empty strings.
2. Function shape: With your examples, this one is easy to knock out of the
   park. Specify what parameters the function needs.
3. Explanation: Explain what you need, and how you will use it.
4. Write your code: Follow your explanation and translate it into code.
5. Test: Go through your code step by step with your examples in step 1 and
   verify that your solution works. (This step will be omitted in our exercise
   examples)

If you don't completely understand the 5 steps above, don't worry. You will get
an example for every exercise for the rest of the book

# Closure

**Note: It might be helpful to review
[Execution Context in JS0](/curriculum/lessons/js0/functions_and_execution_context#execution-context)
before tackling this section.**

Closure is a concept that allows a JavaScript function to keep track of the
values it needs to run, allowing you to do incredible things. Closure simply
means that:

> An inner function always has access to the variables and parameters of its
> outer function, even after the outer function has returned.

Let's see an example. JS0 challenge 2 asked you to create a function that will
add 3 numbers together. Now we'll add 3 numbers, but with a twist: We're going
to create a function that, given 2 numbers, will _return_ a new function that
takes a third number and then adds all three together.

```jsx
const solution = (a, b) => {
  return c => {
    return a + b + c
  }
}

const fun1 = solution(1, 2)
// Even though solution has finished running, the a and b parameters still exist
// a -> 1, b -> 2

// Because of closure, fun1 can access variables a and b
let res = fun1(3) // What is the value of res?
res = fun1(5) // What is the value of res?

res = solution(2, 3)(9) // what is the value of res?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = (a, b) => {
  return c => {
    return a + b + c
  }
}

const fun1 = solution(1, 2)

let res = fun1(3) // 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
res = fun1(5) // 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

res = solution(2, 3)(9) // 2 + 3 + 9 = 14
```

</Spoiler>

In the example above, notice how `fun1` is aware of the arguments (a, b) that
were originally passed into its parent function (`solution`).

Because of closure, a function's variables can change over time. Let's see how
this plays out in the next example. Remember that every function has its own
execution context (variables).

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  let counter = 0
  return () => {
    counter = counter + 1
    if (counter < 3) {
      return 0
    }
    return counter
  }
}
const arya = solution()
let res = arya() // what is res?
const sansa = solution()
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  let counter = 0
  return () => {
    counter = counter + 1
    if (counter < 3) {
      return 0
    }
    return counter
  }
}
const arya = solution()
let res = arya() // res is 0, but arya's counter has become 1
const sansa = solution()
res = arya() + sansa() // 0; arya's counter -> 2, sansa's counter -> 1
res = arya() + sansa() // 3; arya's counter -> 3, sansa's counter -> 2
res = arya() + sansa() // 7; arya's counter -> 4, sansa's counter -> 3
res = arya() + sansa() // 9; arya's counter -> 5, sansa's counter -> 4
res = arya() + sansa() // 11; arya's counter -> 6, sansa's counter -> 5
```

</Spoiler>

solution returns a function that has access to solution's `counter` variable.
Each time the function runs, it updates the counter. Even though we got both
`arya` and `sansa` from solution, they're separate functions so they each have
their execution context, and their own copy of `counter`.

Note that we followed good practice and used `let counter = 0`. What would
happen if instead we just used `counter = 0`?

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  counter = 0 // because there is no let declaration,
  //   counter is in the global scope.
  return () => {
    counter = counter + 1
    if (counter < 3) {
      return 0
    }
    return counter
  }
}
const arya = solution()
let res = arya() // what is res?
const sansa = solution()
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
res = arya() + sansa() // what is res?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const solution = () => {
  counter = 0
  return () => {
    counter = counter + 1
    if (counter < 3) {
      return 0
    }
    return counter
  }
}
const arya = solution()
let res = arya() // res is 0, counter -> 1
const sansa = solution() // counter -> 0
res = arya() + sansa() // 0; counter -> 2
res = arya() + sansa() // 7; 3 + 4
res = arya() + sansa() // 11; 5 + 6
res = arya() + sansa() // 15; 7 + 8
res = arya() + sansa() // 19; 9 + 10
```

What happened? When we created `counter` with no let or const declaration, we
created it in the global scope. That means each function created by solution
doesn't get its own copy for its execution context; they all share the same
`counter`. The reason this is **bad practice** is that functions become
unpredictable when they're allowed to change variables that other functions
might be expecting to stay the same.

## Exercises

From here to the rest of the lesson, the description of the function you are
supposed to solve will be intentionally short and lacking to accurately reflect
the life as a software engineer. No one will write out the instructions for you
in detail. Instead, you will be given examples and you must figure out what the
function does from the examples.

1. Write a function named `hello3x` that _returns a function_. The returned
   function should return "hello" only the first 3 times it's run, then "".

   Example:

   ```jsx
   const threeF = hello3x()
   let b = threeF() // b is "hello"
   b = threeF() // b is "hello"
   b = threeF() // b is "hello"
   b = threeF() // b is ""
   // b will always be "" for all subsequent b = threeF() executions
   ```

<Spoiler>

Let's walk through how we will write this function using the five steps to
solving interview problems: examples, function shape, think, code, test.

1. 3 examples (Not many possibilities for examples here because the problem is
   straightforward)

   ```jsx
   // example 1:
   const b = hello3x()
   b() // returns 'hello'
   b() // returns 'hello'
   b() // returns 'hello'
   b() // returns ''

   // This is too simple, no need for other examples.
   ```

2. Function shape

   `hello3x` takes in 0 arguments and returns a function. The returned function
   takes no arguments.

   ```jsx
   const hello3x = () => {
     return () => {}
   }
   ```

3. Explanation

   1. What variables do you need?
      - We need a counter to keep track of how many times the function has run.
   2. Where do you create the variables?
      - We can't put it in the returned function. If we do it there, then every
        time the returned function is called, the variable is created and then
        removed when function is done. So we must put it outside the returned
        function, right when `hello3x` starts running.
   3. When do you update the variables?
      - Every time the returned function runs, we'll need to update the counter.
        When it reaches 3, the function should stop returning "hello".

   If you are confident that you've nailed down all the steps, start coding!

4. Code

   ```jsx
   const hello3x = () => {
     let counter = 0
     return () => {
       if (counter === 3) {
         return ''
       }
       counter = counter + 1
       return 'hello'
     }
   }
   ```

5. Test

   Walk through your code like a computer, running it through your head with the
   examples in step 1 to make sure your code works

</Spoiler>

2. Write a function named `helloFunction` that returns a function:

   ```jsx
   const moreHello = helloFunction()
   let b = moreHello() // b is "hello"
   b = moreHello() // b is "hellohello"
   b = moreHello() // b is "hellohellohello"
   b = moreHello() // b is "hellohellohellohello"
   // every time moreHello is called, one more "hello" will be appended to variable b.
   ```

<Spoiler>

Let's walk through how we wrote this function using the five steps to solving
interview problems: examples, function shape, think, code, test.

1. Write 3 Examples:

   ```jsx
   // Example A:
   const b = helloFunction()
   let e = b() // e is "hello"
   e = b() // e is "hellohello"
   e = b() // e is "hellohellohello"
   e = b() // e is "hellohellohellohello"
   // every time the function is called, one more "hello" will be appended
   // to variable e.

   // Example B:
   const c = helloFunction()
   c // c is a function

   // This is too simple, no need for other examples.
   ```

2. **Function shape**: `helloFunction` takes in 0 arguments and returns a
   function. The returned function takes no arguments.

   ```jsx
   const helloFunction = () => {
     return () => {}
   }
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   What variables do you need?

   We need to declare the variable that allows us to change its value every time
   the function runs.

   Where do you create the variable?

   We can't put it in the returned function. If we do it there, then every time
   the returned function is called, the variable is created and then removed
   when function is done. So we must put it outside the returned function, right
   when `helloFunction` starts running.

   When do you update the variable?

   Every time the returned function runs, we update the variable by adding
   "hello" to the value of the variable. Return that variable.

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const helloFunction = () => {
     let result = ''
     return () => {
       result = result + 'hello'
       return result
     }
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

3. Write a function named `lessThan` that returns a function:

   ```jsx
   const youngerThanCardiB = lessThan(27)
   let miley = youngerThanCardiB(26) // true, because 26 is smaller than 27
   let nicki = youngerThanCardiB(36) // false, because 36 is not smaller than 27

   const smallerThan = lessThan(2)
   let b = smallerThan(3) // b is false, because 3 is not smaller than 2
   b = smallerThan(5) || youngerThanCardiB(5) // smallerThan(5) is false (falsey)
   // so b takes the value true because youngerThanCardiB(5) returns true
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Hint">

1. First, you must recognize that `lessThan` is a function. You should know how
   to write a function.
1. Next, you should write the shape of the function. Write the parameters and
   return value of the function. What does the returned function return?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example A:
   const youngerThanMary = lessThan(0)
   let b = youngerThanMary(0) // b is true
   b = youngerThanMary(27) // b is false
   b = youngerThanMary(22) // b is false
   b = youngerThanMary(-1) // b is true

   //Example B:
   const youngerThanJohn = lessThan(-35)
   let c = youngerThanJohn(-35) // c is false
   c = youngerThanJohn(0) // c is false
   c = youngerThanJohn(42) // c is false
   c = youngerThanJohn(-24) // c is false
   c = youngerThanJohn(-39) // c is true

   //Example C:
   const youngerThanJane = lessThan(45)
   let d = youngerThanJane(45) // d is false
   d = youngerThanJane(49) // d is false
   d = youngerThanJane(39) // d is true
   d = youngerThanJane(24) // d is true
   ```

2. **Function Shape**

   `lessThan` takes in a parameter and returns a function. The returned function
   takes in a parameter

   ```jsx
   const lessThan27 = n => {
     return n2 => {}
   }
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   Before return - no need to do anything

   Inside returned function - We need an `if` statement to tell the function to
   return a boolean that checks if `n2` is smaller than `n`

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const lessThan = n => {
     return n2 => {
       return n2 < n
     }
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

4. Write a function named `callWith` that takes a number and returns a function.
   The **returned** function takes in a function as its parameter and invokes it
   with the number as argument.

> If the above description sounds like a mouthful, don't worry. Nobody will (or
> should) talk to you like that. Rather, you will be given examples (like below)
> and you will need to figure out what the function `callWith` does before
> solving it.

```jsx
const fun = callWith(10)
let b = fun(num => {
  return num + 5
}) // b is 15

b = fun(num => {
  return num + 'hello'
}) // b is "10hello"

b = fun(num => {
  return 500 % num
}) // b is 0
```

<Spoiler>

Wow, that was a lot of functions, wasn't it? Although it might have been
intimidating that we kept saying "function," hopefully following the 5 steps
helped you through the problem.

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example A:
   const fun = callWith(10)
   let b = fun(() => {}) // b is undefined

   b = fun(num => {
     return num + 'hello0'
   }) // b is "10hello10"

   b = fun(num => {
     return 50 + num
   }) // b is  60

   //Example B:
   const fun2 = callWith('hello')

   let c = fun2(num => {
     return num
   }) // c is "hello"

   c = fun2(num => {
     return num + ' 10hello'
   }) // c is "hello 10hello"

   c = fun2(num => {
     return 'world'
   }) // c is "world"

   //Example C:
   const fun3 = callWith(-10)

   let d = fun3(num => {
     return num + 38
   }) // d is 28

   d = fun3(num => {
     return num + '10'
   }) // d is "-1010"

   d = fun3(num => {
     return 10 * num
   }) // d is -100
   ```

2. **Function Shape**

   `callWIth` takes in an parameter and returns a function.

   returned function takes in a parameter.

   ```jsx
   const callWith = num => {
     return f => {}
   }
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   Before return - no need to do anything

   Inside returned function - return the result of running the argument

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const callWith = num => {
     return f => {
       return f(num)
     }
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

5. Write a function named `runIt` that takes in a function as a parameter and
   returns the function.

   ```jsx
   const subtract = runIt((a, b) => {
     return a - b
   })
   let b = subtract(3, 20) // b is -17
   b = subtract(11, 2) // b is 9
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   // Example A:
   const subtract = runIt((a, b) => {
     return a - b
   })
   let b = subtract(3, 20) // b is -17
   b = subtract(7, 4) // b is 3
   b = subtract(12, 6) // b is 6

   // Example B:
   const fun = runIt((a, b) => {
     return 'hello'
   })
   let c = fun(27, 4) // c is "hello"
   c = fun(12, 12) // c is "hello"

   // Example C:
   const fun2 = runIt((a, b) => {
     return a + b
   })
   let d = fun2(-10, 10) // d is 0
   d = fun2(2, 3) // d is 5
   d = fun2(9, 0) // b is 9
   ```

2. **function shape**

   `runIt` takes a parameter and returns a function

   returned function takes in 2 arguments

   ```jsx
   const runIt = a => {
     return (b, c) => {}
   }
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   Before return - no need to do anything

   Inside returned function - return the result of running the `a`

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const runIt = a => {
     return (b, c) => {
       return a(b, c)
     }
   }
   ```

You may have noticed that some of the exercises and challenges in JS0 are
actually closure examples.

## Real Life Use Case

> If this section goes way over your head, skip it and come back to it later.
> How much later? Just keep coming back over and over again until you get it.

Sometimes when you run a function you want to write an HTML `console.log()`
method to display or print out what is going on in the console. Instead of
writing `console.log()` into every function, you can create a function called
`addLog`. When you want to write a function, you pass your function into
`addLog` like this:

```jsx
// Let's say you want to write a function that adds 2 numbers
const add2 = addLog('sum of 2 numbers', (a, b) => {
  return a + b
})

// Let's say you want to write a function that checks if the first number
//    is bigger than the second number
const isFirstBigger = addLog('comparing 2 numbers', (a, b) => {
  return a > b
})

// Let's use these functions!
let result = add2(5, 2) // result is 7
if (isFirstBigger(result, 5)) {
  result = 100
}
// result is 100

result = add2(result, 5)
// result is 105

/*
At the same time, because add2 and isFirstBigger is created by addLog
you will see logs printed out!

sum of 2 numbers, 5, 2
comparing 2 numbers, 7, 5
sum of 2 numbers, 100, 5

These logs are incredibly helpful if you need to figure out what went wrong.
*/
```

**AddLog Implementation**

```jsx
const addLog = (msg, fn) => {
  return (a, b) => {
    console.log(msg, a, b)
    return fn(a, b)
  }
}
```

# Default Parameters

Sometimes, when another developer calls your function, they may have nothing to
pass to any of the parameters. To get around that, you can define **default
values** for your parameters. In the next section, you'll see how this allows us
to create all kinds of powerful functions. For now, see this example of a
function that adds 1 to the sum of its parameters.

```jsx
const add1 = (x = 3, y = 2) => {
  return x + y + 1
}
let res = add1 // what is res?

res = add1(1) + add1() + add1(4, 5) // what is res?

res = add1(5) === add1(2, 3) + 2 // what is res?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const add1 = (x = 3, y = 2) => {
  return x + y + 1
}
let res = add1 // function

res = add1(1) + add1() + add1(4, 5) // 20; [1+2+1] + [3+2+1] + [4+5+1]

res = add1(5) === add1(2, 3) + 2 // true; 8 === 8
```

When a function has default parameters and you call the function with only some
arguments, the parameters will be filled with arguments starting from the left.
When we ran `add1(1)`, x took the value 1 and y took its default value 2. When
we gave no arguments (`add1()`), both x and y took their default values.
Finally, when we ran `add1(4,5)` both x and y had values specified so neither
one took its default.

</Spoiler>

# Recursion

In the previous section, we created functions that return other functions that
must be called again and again to get different results. What if instead we
created a function that only needs to call _itself_? This is called recursion.

For example, say you wanted to add up all the numbers from 1 to 999. You would
need to create a variable to hold the sum, then add 1 to the sum, add 2 to the
sum, add 3 to the sum, ... add 999 to the sum, and then return the sum. Let's
start with a much smaller number (3) so we can follow it through the whole
process:

```jsx
const addTo3 = (counter = 1, result = 0) => {
  if (counter > 3) {
    return result
  }
  return addTo3(counter + 1, result + counter)
}
let res = addTo3 // what is res?

res = addTo3(2) // what is res?
res = addTo3() // what is res?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const addTo3 = (counter = 1, result = 0) => {
  if (counter > 3) {
    return result
  }
  return addTo3(counter + 1, result + counter)
}
let res = addTo3 // function

res = addTo3(2) // 5
/*
 * return fun1(3, 2)
 *   return fun1(4, 5)
 *     return 5
 */
res = addTo3() // 6
```

</Spoiler>

The `addTo3` function above adds up all the numbers from 1 to 3 (if no arguments
are given). When writing a function like this, it is important to think through
these steps before coding:

**What variables do I need?**

- We need a number that increments one at a time (1, 2, 3) starting at 1. When
  this number becomes greater than 3, we know we are done! Let's call this
  variable `counter`.
- We need a variable that stores the sum of all the numbers that we have added
  up, starting at 0. Let's call this variable `result`.

We can just add these variables to the function parameters (if needed):
`counter=1, result=0`.

**When does the function stop?**

When counter reaches 4, we would have finished adding all the numbers from 1-3,
so we can return `result` to stop the function from executing anymore:
`if (counter > 3) return result`.

**If we are not at the end, how do we proceed?**

Since we are not at the end, we just call the function again and increment
counter by 1, then add counter to our result:
`return addTo3(counter + 1, result + counter)`.

## Writing A Recursive Function

Let's recap the steps for writing a recursive function:

1. **Parameters:** Figure out what variables you need, add them to your function
   as parameters, and give them a default value.
2. **Base case:** Write an if condition telling your function when to stop and
   exit.
3. **Recursive case:** Write logic for the next iteration.

### Example

Write a function named sumToMe that takes in a number and returns the sum of all
numbers from 0 to that number.

```jsx
const res = sumToMe(5) // res should be 15 because 5+4+3+2+1+0
```

This will be similar to our addTo3 example above, but now instead of counting up
to a fixed number, we will count down from whatever number is passed in. (You
can also write this function by using a counter. We opted not to do it here so
we create fewer parameters.)

1. **Parameters:** In addition to the required parameter, we need a variable to
   keep track of the sum. Let's call this variable `sum`. sum should start with
   a default value of 0.
2. **Base case:** When we've counted down to 0, there are no numbers left to add
   so we should stop and return the result that we have collected:
   `if (input <= 0) return sum`.

   We write `input <= 0` in our check just in case someone used our function
   incorrectly by passing in a negative number. For instance: `sumToMe(-3)`.

3. **Recursive case:** The rest of the logic is simple; at each step we just add
   the current number to the result and decrease the number.

   ```jsx
   const sumToMe = (input, sum = 0) => {
     if (input <= 0) {
       return sum
     }
     return sumToMe(input - 1, sum + input)
   }
   ```

## Exercises

Some of these questions have been asked during onsite interviews, so make sure
you attempt these problems and understand how to do them.

Make sure you think through the steps first before attempting to solve the
problem.

1. Write a function named love that calls
   `console.log("The things I do for love")` 99 times.

   ```jsx
   love()
   /*
   The things I do for love
   The things I do for love
   ... (96 times)
   The things I do for love
   */
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Explanation**: There are no parameters and no return values, so we don't
   need to provide any examples
2. **Function Shape:** `love` does not take in any parameters and does not
   return anything

   ```jsx
   const love = () => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   1. We need a parameter that is a counter that starts at 0.
   2. when counter is 99, return (stop the function)
   3. print
   4. Move to next function with next counter
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const love = (counter = 0) => {
     if (counter === 99) {
       return
     }
     console.log('The things I do for love')
     return love(counter + 1)
   }
   ```

<Spoiler name = "Debrief">

1. **Parameters:** We'll need a counter to keep track of how many times solution
   has run. Let's start it at 0.
2. **Base case:** When the counter reaches 99, return. Note that because our
   function calls on console.log to do something and doesn't return any value
   itself, we can just put `return` to end the recursion.
3. **Recursive case:** If the counter is still below 99, print 'The things I do
   for love', bring the counter one step closer to 99, and go again.

   It might look strange to see `return love(i+1)` in the recursive case, but
   only `return` in the base case. Shouldn't a function always either have a
   return value or not?

   Each of the 99 calls to `love` will pass its return value to the `love` that
   called it, and saying `return` is like saying `return undefined`. So the very
   last call will pass an `undefined` return value all the way back to first
   call, and the first call will end up returning `undefined`.

Did you start at 99 and count down to 1? That’s OK too. Sometimes there is more
than one way to solve a recursive problem. Just be careful, because sometimes
counting down vs. up can change the final output of a recursive function. The
next exercise is one example where the direction you count can completely change
the result!

2. Write a function named countTo98 that calls `console.log` once for every
   number from 0 to 98.

   ```jsx
   countTo98()
   /*
   0
   1
   2
   ...
   98
   */
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Explanation**: There are no parameters and no return values, so we don't
   need to provide any examples
2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const countTo98 = () => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0 and keeps track of
     which number we are on.
   - When `i` is greater than 98, return
   - Console.log `i`
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const countTo98 = (i = 0) => {
     if (i > 98) {
       return
     }
     console.log(i)
     return countTo98(i + 1)
   }

3. Write a function named countToMe that calls `console.log` for every number
   from 8 to the input number.

   ```jsx
   countToMe(10)

   */
   ```

   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const countToMe = num => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 8
   - When `i` is greater than num, return
   - Console.log `i`
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const countToMe = (num, i = 8) => {
     if (i > num) {
       return
     }
     console.log(i)
     return countToMe(num, i + 1)

4. Write a function named fizzbuzz that call `console.log` for every number from
   1 to the input number. However, if the number is divisible by 3, log `"fizz"`
   instead and if the number is divisible by 5, log `"buzz"` instead. If the
   number is divisible by both, log `"fizzbuzz"`.

   ```jsx
   fizzbuzz(16)
   /*

   ```jsx
   //Example 1
   fizzbuzz(-3)
   /*

   //Example 2
   fizzbuzz(0)
   /*

   //Example 2
   fizzbuzz(3)
   /*

   */

   //Example 2
   fizzbuzz(5)
   /*

   2
   fizz
   4
   buzz
   */
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const fizzbuzz = num => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0.
   - When `i` is greater than `num` , return.
   - We need a local variable (let's say `val`) to store what the output should
     be at each `num` . Initial value is `i`
   - If `i` is divisible by 3, assign `fizz` to `val` .
   - If `i` is divisible by 5, assign `buzz` to `val` .
   - If `i` is divisible by 3 **and** 5, assign `fizzbuzz` to `val` .
   - console.log `val`
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const fizzbuzz = (num, i = 1) => {
     if (i > num) {
       return
     }
     let val = i
     if (i % 3 === 0) {
       val = 'fizz'
     }
     if (i % 5 === 0) {
       val = 'buzz'
     }
     if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
       val = 'fizzbuzz'
     }
     console.log(val)
     return fizzbuzz(num, i + 1)

5. Write a function named `numberedHello` that returns a string with the same
   number of `"hello"` as a given number.

   ```jsx
   numberedHello(5) // "hellohellohellohellohello"
   numberedHello(0) // ""
   numberedHello(-4) // ""
   ```

<Spoiler name="Hint">
  This exercise is very similar to `moreHello` (Closure, exercise 2). Instead of
  a variable outside the function, here you'll use a default parameter to keep
  track of the text that will be returned.
</Spoiler>

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example 1
   const a = numberedHello(0) // a is ""

   //Example 2
   const b = numberedHello(-3) // b is ""

   //Example 3
   const c = numberedHello(2) // c is "hellohello"
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const numberedHello = num => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `result`) that stores an empty string ""
     initially.
   - When `num` is less than 1, return `result`
   - Add `"hello"` to `result`
   - Continue by decreasing `num` and passing in `"hello" + result` into the
     next function.
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const numberedHello = (num, result = '') => {
     if (num < 1) {
       return result
     }
     return numberedHello(num - 1, result + 'hello')
   }
   ```

   <Spoiler>

   **Parameters:** Of course we need a counter like in the previous examples.
   But this time we'll also need a result variable to store all the hellos. This
   is just like exercise 2 in the Closure section, except that now we're using
   recursion. Our result will start as an empty string "", and our recursive
   function calls can pass it to each other to build onto.

   **Base case:** When the counter reaches 0, return the result variable with
   all the hellos. (Note that we said `if ( num < 1 )`. What would happen if we
   wrote `if ( num === 0 )` and someone called `solution(-1)`?)

   **Recursive case:** Decrease the counter and add one "hello" to the result as
   we call this function again.

6. Write a function named `sumEvens` that adds up all the positive even numbers
   from 2 to the given number. (Use `%` to determine if each number is even.)

   ```jsx
   let result = sumEvens(5) // result is 6 because 4 + 2
   result = sumEvens(1) // result is 0
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example 1
   const a = sumEvens(-8) // a is 0

   //Example 2
   const b = sumEvens(0) // b is 0

   //Example 3
   const d = sumEvens(2) // d is 2

   //Example 4
   const c = sumEvens(10) // c is 30 : (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const sumEvens = num => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `result`) that has a value of 0 initially.
   - When `num` is less than or equal to 0, return.
   - If `num` is even, add it to `result` .
   - Continue by decreasing `num`
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const sumEvens = (num, result = 0) => {
     if (num <= 0) {
       return result
     }
     if (num % 2 === 0) {
       result = result + num
     }
     return sumEvens(num - 1, result)
   }

7. Write a function named `tryNumRange` that takes in a number and a function
   and calls the function with every number from 1 to the input number. If any
   of these return true, return true; if they all return false, return false.

   ```jsx
   let res = tryNumRange(15, e => {
     return e > 10
   }) // res is true, because the input function returns
   // true when it is called with 11

   res = tryNumRange(8, e => {
     return e === 19
   }) // res is false, because passing 1-8 into
   // the input function will never return true
   ```

<Spoiler name="Hint">
  You'll need to include a default parameter when writing this function.
</Spoiler>

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example 1
   let res = tryNumRange(0, e => {
     return e + 10 > 20
   }) // res is false since range does not include 0

   //Example 2
   res = tryNumRange(-2, e => {
     return e % 2 === 0
   }) // res is false since negative numbers are not included in the range

   //Example 3
   res = tryNumRange(8, e => {
     return e === 19
   }) // res is false, because passing 1-8 into
   // the input function will never return true

   //Example 4
   res = tryNumRange(8, e => {
     return true
   }) // res is true
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const tryNumRange = (num, fun) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - We need a variable (let's say `counter`) that starts at 1.
   - When `counter` is greater than num, return false.
   - When running `fun` with `counter` as argument is truthy, return true.
   - Continue

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const tryNumRange = (num, fun, counter = 1) => {
     if (counter > num) {
       return false
     }
     if (fun(counter)) {
       return true
     }
     return tryNumRange(num, fun, counter + 1)
   }
   ```

8. Look at the code below and try to figure out how to use `fun1`. Next, write
   some code that calls `fun1`.

   ```jsx
   // fun1 runs b (2nd argument) x times
   fun1(99, () => {
     console.log('hello')
   })
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example 1
   const a = fun(2, () => {
   	console.log("c0d3")
   })

   /*
   "c0d3"
   "c0d3"
   a is undefined since there is no value being returned.
   It prints out string 'c0d3' 2 times.

   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const fun1 = (x, b) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - You are a value `x` a function `b`
   - When `x` is less than or equal to 0, return
   - Call the `b` function
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const fun1 = (x, b) => {
     if (x <= 0) {
       return
     }
     b()
     return fun1(x - 1, b)
   }

# Strings And Characters

Now that you know recursion, let's learn more about strings so you can tackle
the harder string problems.

A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Smith". A string
can be any text inside double or single quotes:

const a = "iPhone 11"

const b = 'iPhone 11'

String indices are zero-based: The first character is in position 0, the second
in 1, and so on.

To access a character in a string, you can use square brackets with the
position. For example, `"hello"[1]` will give you the character `"e"` in the
second position.

Strings also have a special property called `length`. For example,
`"hello".length` will give you 5 which is the length of "hello".

## Example

Write a function named solution that takes in a string and calls `console.log()`
for every letter in the string.

1. **3 Examples** - Let's make sure we understand the problem!

   ```jsx
   //Example 1
   const a = logString('') // returns undefined since we are passing in empty string as argument.

   //Example 2
   const c = logString(' ') // c logs empty space
   /*
   " "(empty space)
   */

   //Example 3
   const b = logString('Hello') // b is
   /*
   H
   e
   l
   l
   o
   */
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const logString = str => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0 and keeps track of
     where we are in `str`
   - When we arrive at the end (`i` is equal to `str.length`), return.
   - Console.log `str[i]`
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const logString = (str, i = 0) => {
     if (i >= str.length) {
       return
     }
     console.log(str[i])
     return logString(str, i + 1)
   }
   ```

**Debrief**

1. **Parameters:** You'll quickly notice a pattern with many recursion problems
   involving strings. Just like in the previous section, they'll have a counter,
   and this time it will keep our place in the string.
2. **Base case:** Going one character at a time, the base case is when we get to
   end of the string.
3. **Recursive case:** Just update the counter to point to the next character.

Not too bad, right? Ready to try some on your own?

## Exercises

1. Write a function named `logNonMatching` that `console.log`s every character
   in a word, except for one given character.

   ```jsx
   logNonMatching('banana', 'a')
   // Will print out everything not matching "a":
   /*
   b
   n
   n

   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example 1

   c
   i
   e
   n

   //Example 3
   logNonMatching('ccc', 'c') // output is ""
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const logNonMatching = (str, character) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0 and keeps track of
     where we are in `str`.
   - When `i` equals `str.length` (we are at the end) return.
   - If `str[i]` doesn't equal `character`, console.log `str[i]`
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const logNonMatching = (str, character, i = 0) => {
     if (i === str.length) return
     if (str[i] !== character) console.log(str[i])

2. Write a function named `logFirstX` that logs a given number of characters
   from the _beginning_ of a string.

   ```jsx
   logFirstX('Winterfell', 3)
   // Will print out (3 characters):
   /*
   W
   i
   n
   */
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example 1
   const a = logFirstX("", 4) // logs "" since there is nothing to log

   //Example 2
   const b = logFirstX("Happy", 10) // logs the whole string
   /*
   H
   a
   p
   p
   y

   //Example 3
   const c = logFirstX("I am having a great day!", 5)
   /*
   I
   " "(empty space)
   a
   m
   " "(empty space)
   /*
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const logFirstX = (str, num) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0 and keeps track of
     where we are in `str`.
   - When `i` is ≥ `num` or `i` is ≥ `str.length`, return
   - print out the character at index `i`
   - Continue
4. Code

   ```jsx
   const logFirstX = (str, num, i = 0) => {
     if (i >= num || i >= str.length) {
       return
     }

3. Write a function named `lastX` that _returns_ (not console.log) a chunk of a
   given size from the _end_ of a string.

   ```jsx
   lastX('Winterfell', 3) // returns "ell"
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   // Example 1
   const b = lastX('', 4) // b is ""

   // Example 2
   const a = lastX('hello', -11) // a is ""

   // Example 3
   const d = lastX('a', 1) // d is "a"

   // Example 4
   const c = lastX('Winter', 8) // c is "Winter"
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const lastX = (str, num) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**

   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at the last character index:
     `str.length - 1`
   - We need a variable (let's say `result` ) that starts with "" to collect all
     the characters.
   - When `result`'s length is ≥ to `num` or if `i` becomes smaller than 0, we
     know we are done so return `result`
   - Add result to `str[i]`
   - Continue (by decreasing i)

4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const lastX = (str, num, result = '', i = str.length - 1) => {
     if (result.length >= num || i < 0) {
       return result
     }
     return lastX(str, num, str[i] + result, i - 1)

4. Write a function named `logOddOnly` that prints out only the characters at
   odd indices (remember, index starts at 0) from a string.

   ```jsx
   logOddOnly('catelyn')
   // Will print out (3 characters):
   /*
   a
   e
   y
   */
   ```

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   //Example 1

   /*
    (empty space)
   o
   e
   c
   d
   n
   !
   */

   //Example 3
   logOddOnly(" This is fun! ") // "Ti sfn "
   // Will print out (7 characters):
   /*
   T
   i

   s
   f
   n
    (empty space)
   */
   ****
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const logOddOnly = str => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0 and keeps track of
     where we are in `str`.
   - When we are at the end of `str`, return.
   - We check if `i` is odd and if it is, we print out `str[i]` .
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const logOddOnly = (str, i = 0) => {
     if (i === str.length) return
     if (i % 2 !== 0)
       // A quicker way is to simply do i % 2
       console.log(str[i])

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   // Example 1
   const a = removeCharacter(' ', 'abc') // a is ''

   // Example 2
   const b = removeCharacter('Jump', 'i') // b is "Jump"

   // Example 3
   const c = removeCharacter('Iblovebcoding!', 'b') // c is "Ilovecoding!"
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const removeCharacter = (str, letter) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0 and keeps track of
     where we are in `str`.
   - We need a variable (let's say `acc`) that starts with `""` and we add to
     it.
   - When we get to the end of the string, return `acc`
   - Add to `acc` (if `str[i]` doesn't match `letter` )
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const removeCharacter = (str, character, i = 0, acc = '') => {
     if (i === str.length) {

6. Write a function named `secretCodeGenerator` that takes in 3 parameters: a
   string, a letter, and a string, and returns a string where all the matching
   letters are replaced by the last input string.

   ```jsx
   secretCodeGenerator('banana', 'a', '*z*') // b*z*n*z*n*z*
   ```

   // returns ''

   // Example 2: no matches to replace
   secretCodeGenerator('acd', 'b', 'hello')
   // returns 'acd'

   // Example 3: Removes b and add space " " instead.
   secretCodeGenerator('Ibambhappy', 'b', ' ')
   // returns 'I am happy'

   // Example 4: Replaces "o" with "u"
   secretCodeGenerator('Boomerang', 'o', 'u')
   // returns 'Buumerang'
   ```

2. **Shape**

   ```jsx
   const secretCodeGenerator = (str, letter, replacement) => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable (let's say `i`) that starts at 0 and keeps track of
     where we are in `str`
   - We need a variable `acc` that starts with `""` and we add to it character
     by character
     - if the `str[i]` matches letter, we add the replacement.
     - Otherwise, we add the letter.
   - When we get to the end of the string, return `acc`
   - Add to `acc` (could be `str[i]` or `replacement` )
   - Continue
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const secretCodeGenerator = (str, letter, replacement, i = 0, acc = '') => {
     if (i >= str.length) {
       return acc
     }
     if (str[i] === letter) {
       acc = acc + replacement
     } else {
       acc = acc + str[i]
     }
     return secretCodeGenerator(str, letter, replacement, i + 1, acc)
   }
   ```

# Async

This section will cover the asynchronous nature of JavaScript that
differentiates it from other languages. To understand it, let's explore a
hypothetical scenario:

If you are baking pizza and you put the pizza into the oven, do you wait until
the pizza is done before doing something else? Probably not. You will probably
do other things and and come back to it after the oven finishes cooking the
pizza. Usually, the oven will let you know when it is done (like emitting a
beep).

JavaScript works the same way. In the following example, `setTimeout` (you might
remember this function from Preflight) takes in 2 arguments, a function and a
time (in milliseconds). The function will run after the milliseconds have
passed.

```jsx
let points = 0
setTimeout(() => {
  points = 5
}, 1000) // function will run after 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second)

let res = points // res is 0.
// JavaScript keeps going and does not sit around and wait.
// How do you fix the code so res takes the value of points after points is updated?
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
let points = 0
let res = 0
setTimeout(() => {
  // note that this function (which will run after 1000ms)
  //   is doing 2 things:
  //   1. setting points to 5
  //   2. setting res to points.
  points = 5
  res = points
}, 1000)
```

</Spoiler>

```jsx
let points = 2
setTimeout(() => {
  if (points < 5) {
    console.log(points) // will console.log be called?
  }
}, 1000)

points = 10
```

<Spoiler>

No, since JavaScript does not wait around, points = 10 executes before the
callback function.

</Spoiler>

> **callbacks** are functions that are passed into another function as
> arguments.

## Exercises

1. Write a function named wait20 that waits 20 seconds and then calls
   `console.log("one")`.

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   wait20() // after 20 seconds, "one" will be printed out.
   ```

2. **Function Shape**

   ```jsx
   const wait20 = () => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need to run `setTimeout`, which takes in a function and a number (20
     seconds)
     - The callback function will run `console.log`
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const wait20 = () => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log('one')
     }, 20 * 1000) // setTimeout uses milliseconds. 1000 milliseconds per second
   }
   // FYI. wait20 will return undefined, because it has no return
   ```

</Spoiler>

2. Write a function named `oneAndTwo` that waits 20 seconds and then calls
   `console.log("one")`, then waits another 10 seconds and then calls
   `console.log("two")`. _Reminder: 'two' will appear 30 seconds after the
   function is run._

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   oneAndTwo()
   /* 
   ... 20 seconds later ...
   "one"
   ... 10 seconds later...
   "two"
   */
   ```

2. **Function Shape**

   ```jsx
   const oneAndTwo = () => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need to run `setTimeout`, and pass in 2 arguments, a function and 20000
   - The callbackfunction will:
     - run `console.log`
     - run `setTimeout` with 2 arguments, a function and 1000
       - The callback function will run `console.log`
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const oneAndTwo = () => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log('one')

       setTimeout(() => {
         console.log('two')
       }, 10 * 1000)
     }, 20 * 1000) // setTimeout uses milliseconds. 1000 milliseconds per second
   }
   ```

</Spoiler>

3. Write a function that takes in a string, and calls `console.log` for every
   character in the string, 1 second after each call (aka 1 character per
   second).

<Spoiler>

1. **Examples**

   ```jsx
   // Example 1
   printLetter('')
   /*
    */

   // Example 2
   printLetter('hello')
   /*
   ... 1 second later ...
   "h"
   ... 1 second later...
   "e"
   ... 1 second later...
   "l"
   ... 1 second later...
   "l"
   ... 1 second later...
   "o"
   */
   ```

2. **Function Shape**

   ```jsx
   const printLetter = str => {}
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - We need a variable `i` to keep track of which letter we are on, starting
     from 0
   - If we are at the end of the string, `i === str.length`, stop / return
   - run `setTimeout` and pass in a function and 1000
     - log the letter
     - In callback function, continue by running `printLetter` with `i+1` .
4. **Code**

   ```jsx
   const printLetter = (str, i = 0) => {
     if (i === str.length) {
       return
     }
     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(str[i])
       printLetter(str, i + 1)
     }, 1000)
   }
   ```

4. What's wrong with the solution on the left for the previous exercise (1
   letter per second)?

<Image

/>

<Spoiler>

Function on the left will completely stop in about.... 1 second. All the letters
gets printed out all at once after about 1 second, no matter how long the string
is.

# Lesson Challenges

Please solve these challenges with recursive functions instead of using `for` or
`while` loops. Some of these challenges do not need a recursive solution, but if
you feel the need to use `for` or `while`, then please use recursion instead.
