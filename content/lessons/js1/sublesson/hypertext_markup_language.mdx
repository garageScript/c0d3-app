# Preflight

This section contains a few questions for you to answer to make sure you
understand the concepts from the previous chapter.

Before proceeding with the exercises, create a new branch in git

- `git checkout -b JS1` where JS1 is the new branch name

For the first 4 exercises, write a line of code that uses each function. Note
that not all these functions exist, so you don’t need to try running them on
your computer. Here's an example:

**Example**

Run the `includes` function, which takes in 1 argument, a string.

<Spoiler>

```js
includes('hello')
```

</Spoiler>

**Exercises**

1. Run the `map` function, which takes in 1 argument, a function.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
map(() => {})
```

</Spoiler>

2. Run the `setTimeout` function, which takes in 2 arguments, a function and a
   number.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {}, 500)
```

</Spoiler>

3. Run the `app.get` function, which takes in 2 arguments, a string and a
   function.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
app.get('bonjour', () => {})
```

</Spoiler>

4. Run the `fs.writeFile` function, which takes in 3 arguments: a string, a
   string, and a function.

<Spoiler>

```jsx
fs.writeFile('hola', 'aloha', () => {})
```

</Spoiler>

5. Solve the following:

   ```jsx
   const lannister = input => {
     return input
   }
   const stark = () => {
     return 99
   }
   let res = stark // what is res?

   res = lannister(stark) // what is res?

   res = lannister(stark()) // what is res?
   ```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const lannister = input => {
  return input
}
const stark = () => {
  return 99
}
let res = stark // function: stark

res = lannister(stark) // function: stark

res = lannister(stark()) // 99
```

</Spoiler>

6. Solve the following:

   ```jsx
   const baratheon = run_me => {
     return run_me() + 5
   }
   const tyrell = () => {
     return 10
   }

   let res = tyrell // what is res?

   res = baratheon(tyrell) // what is res?

   res = baratheon(() => {
     return 92
   }, 3) // what is res?

   res = baratheon(() => {
     const b = 95
     tyrell()
   }) // what is res?
   ```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const baratheon = run_me => {
  return run_me() + 5
}
const tyrell = () => {
  return 10
}
let res = tyrell // res is a function: tyrell

res = baratheon(tyrell) // res has 15

res = baratheon(() => {
  return 92
}, 3) // res has 97
// The second argument is designed to trick you.
// baratheon does not care about any other argument other
//   than the first one.

res = baratheon(() => {
  const b = 95
  tyrell()
}) // res has NaN (Not a Number)
// (undefined + 5 will be shown as NaN, Not a Number)
// BEWARE! This error happens all the time, so be careful.
// If a function has no return value, it will return undefined
// no matter what the functions inside it returned.
```

How did you do? If you had any issues solving any of the Preflight questions,
please review the previous lesson by doing all the exercises and challenges
again. When you're confident you have a strong foundation, let's move on!

# Overview

In the last lesson, you learned the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript.

This lesson will build on the foundations covered in the previous lesson and
will introduce you to some core concepts of JavaScript (which are heavily tested
in technical interviews!) in two parts:

The first part is an introduction to web development so you can put your
JavaScript knowledge to practical use and build simple web pages. You will be
learning **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) and how JavaScript comes into play
on the web.

The second part covers **closure**, **recursion**, and the **asynchronous**
nature of JavaScript.

Like the previous lesson, make sure you follow along by running the example code
yourself. If the concept is new to you, do not copy and paste. You will learn
better if you type out the code yourself.

# HTML

This section will teach you how to build a web page using **HTML**, which is
simply text written a certain way so your browser (eg. Firefox, Chrome, Safari,
etc.) can read it as a **set of instructions.**

In HTML, we call each instruction an HTML tag**.**

Tags consist of the tag name surrounded by angle brackets, namely the < and >
characters.

e.g. `<h1>` is a tag with tag name h1

Some tags do not require a closing tag or content:

```jsx
<input type="text" />
<br />
```

The `input` tag tells the browser to display an input box that the user can type
into.

So if you see a tag without closing tags, it is probably okay. This tag is
called a self-closing tag, which ends with a `/>` instead of just `>`. You do
not need to remember which tags should be closed or not, simply close all your
tags and you will have no issues.

Here's an example of how you would write an `h1` tag.

`<h1> This is header line 1 </h1>`

Both `<h1>` and `</h1>` are HTML tags: `<h1>` is called the opening tag whereas
`</h1>` is called the closing tag.

`h1` is the **tagname**

Note: **h1** is a header tag and is usually the title of the HTML page. It has
the largest text on the page. There are 6 header tags: h1 to h6.

```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
```

# How To Follow Along

First, create a file with your favorite code editor (Vim, VSCode, Atom, etc.)
and make sure the file name ends with a `.html` (eg. `index.html`). Write the
following example into your file and save:

```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<input />
```

When you open the file (double click or right click → open with browser), you
should see a _Welcome!_ heading and an _input_ box. The large _Welcome!_ text
and the _input_ box that the browser displays from the `h1` and `input`
elements.

> Tips: If you are using VSCode, save the file and then right click on the code
> and choose **View in Browser**. The default browser will be launched.

An HTML element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag:

`<tagname> Content </tagname>`

> Make sure you understand the difference between **tags** (`<h1>`) and
> **elements** (the instructions that are displayed to the user).

When you open an HTML file with a browser, the browser reads and interprets the
HTML instructions (elements) and then displays the resulting web page.

# HTML Example

Here is an example of 7 HTML tags.

Create a new HTML file, call it `challenge1.html`

```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>JS1</h2>
<h5>Challenge 1</h5>
<input type="text" />
<input type="text" />
<button>Submit</button>
<hr />
```

Save the file and open it in your browser, and try to match each tag instruction
with its corresponding element!

(Note that we're getting you started on a later exercise, in which you will
write HTML instructions for Challenge 1 from the previous lesson.)

FYI: `<hr />` creates a horizontal line.

Your browser should render the following elements onto your page:

<Image
  src="/assets/curriculum/lessons/js1/welcome.png"
  height="200"
  width="759"
/>

<div></div>

# Attributes

Notice that in the above example, `input` tags are different from the rest. They
have `type="text"`. These are called **attributes.**

> Attributes provide more information about the tag to the browser.

_For the example above, try changing the value of the input tag's `type`
attribute from `text` to `password`, `number`, or `file` and see what happens
(make sure to type into the input tag)._

Tags can have multiple attributes and they are written in this format:

```html
<tagName attribute1="attribute1 value" attribute2="attribute2 value" ...>
  content
</tagName>
```

For example,

```html
<input class="c1input1" type="text" />
```

The `input` tag has 2 attributes, `class` and `type`.

- `type` tells the browser what type of input box to display (number, text,
  file, password etc.).
- The `class` attribute will be covered in the section below.

If you want to learn more details about a certain tag or element, information is
readily available on the Internet.

For example, if you want to find out more about the `input` tag and its
attributes, open your favorite search engine and search `html input tag`. The
search results on the first page should take you to documentation with
everything you need to know about `input`.

Examples of reputable sources are
[w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp),
[mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

# Browser JavaScript

So far the web pages we've written have been **static**—the browser renders
(displays) the page once, then doesn’t interact with us after that. The sites
you’re used to probably have more interesting behavior. This is often done with
JavaScript. JavaScript is used to manipulate the HTML elements on a page _after_
the page has been rendered, depending on lots of factors such as what the user
does, how much time has gone by, or even information the page receives from
other websites.

This is called **dynamic** behavior. To get started, we'll add a `<script>` tag,
which tells the browser to treat the text inside as JavaScript and run the code.

Example:

```jsx
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>JS1</h2>
<h5>Challenge 1</h5>
<input type="text" />
<input type="text" />
<button>Submit</button>
<hr/>
<script>
alert("Hello")
</script>
```

When you put the above HTML into your `challenge1.html` file and reload it in
your browser, you will notice a popup. This popup is created when the browser
runs the `alert` JavaScript function.

Note: The `alert()` function or method displays an alert window (or popup) with
a specified message and an OK button.

In addition to `alert`, the browser also provides you with many other cool
functions that you can run (covered in the next section).

What would happen if you ran the `alert` function twice, like in the example
below?

```jsx
<script>alert("Zero") alert("Waste!") // What will happen?</script>
```

<Spoiler>
  <p>Two alert windows are displayed</p> <p>1. "Zero"</p> <p> 2. "Waste!"</p>
</Spoiler>

<BlockQuote>

<div>

At this point, you should know that there are 2 ways to run JavaScript:

- Run the JavaScript in the browser using (`<script>` tag).

- Or run the JavaScript directly on your computer using `node`.

</div>

</BlockQuote>

# Getting HTML Elements

In the previous example we learned how to use the browser's `alert` function. As
we keep going, follow along by editing your `challenge1.html` file.

`document.querySelector` is another common JavaScript method (or function)
supported by most browsers. It takes a string argument and returns the first
element that matches the string:

```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>JS0</h2>
<h5>Challenge 1</h5>
<input type="text" />
<input type="text" />
<button>Submit</button>
<hr />
<script>
  const jon = document.querySelector('input') // jon is the first input element
</script>
```

In the example above, we ran the `document.querySelector` method (or function)
and passed in `'input'` as the argument. This method searches through all the
elements on the page and returns the first element that matches the specified
selectors (in this case an input element).

There are 2 input elements—how do you get the second input element? or third?

The simplest approach is to give each `input` a `class` attribute.

When we run the `document.querySelector` method, we pass in `.` followed by the
element's `class` name as a string argument. This argument tells the function to
look up elements by their class attribute (aka **class name**). Note that the
`.` in front of the class name tells the function to look for elements by class
name rather than by element like we did before.

```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>JS0</h2>
<h5>Challenge 1</h5>
<input class="input1" type="text" />
<input class="input2" type="text" />
<button class="submit1">Submit</button>
<hr />
<script>
  const element1 = document.querySelector('.input1') // what is element1?
  const element2 = document.querySelector('.input2') // what is element2?
  const button1 = document.querySelector('.submit1') // what is button1?
</script>
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
const element1 = document.querySelector('.input1') // 1st input element
const element2 = document.querySelector('.input2') // 2nd input element
const button1 = document.querySelector('.submit1') // button element
```

</Spoiler>

An element can have more than one class. To give an element multiple classes,
add a space between each class name. In the example below, `input` element has 3
classes: `input2`, `input`, and `hello` .

```jsx
<input class="input2 input hello" type="text" />
<script>
const element1 = document.querySelector('.input2')
const element2 = document.querySelector('.input')
const element3 = document.querySelector('.hello')

const isOneTwoSame = element1 === element2   // what is isOneTwoSame?
const isOneThreeSame = element1 === element3 // what is isOneThreeSame?
const isTwoThreeSame = element2 === element3 // what is isTwoThreeSame?

// You can also select elements with multiple classes
const isSame = element1 === document.querySelector('.hello.input') // what is isSame?
</script>
```

<Spoiler>

```jsx
<input class="input2 input hello" type="text" />
<script>
const element1 = document.querySelector('.input2')
const element2 = document.querySelector('.input')
const element3 = document.querySelector('.hello')

// element1, element2, element3 variable are all the same elements
const isOneTwoSame = element1 === element2   // true
const isOneThreeSame = element1 === element3 // true
const isTwoThreeSame = element2 === element3 // true

// You can also select elements with multiple classes
const isSame = element1 === document.querySelector('.hello.input') // true
</script>
```

## Element Properties

Every HTML element has properties. This is sort of like attributes in HTML, but
properties are a **JavaScript** concept, and they tell the browser what
**dynamic** behavior to give the elements. Now that you've learned how to get
elements from the page, you can do some really fun stuff using their properties.
In this section we will go over two common properties, **onclick** and
**value**, and how to use them.

## onClick event

Whenever you click on an element, the browser will try to run the element's
`onclick` event function. Therefore, by assigning a function to an element's
onclick event property, we can do something whenever the element is clicked.

In the following example, when you click on the button a popup will show up. If
you want to try it out, edit the `index.html` page you created in the beginning,
or start a new one.

```html
<button class="submit1">Click Me</button>
<script>
  // make sure you put this JavaScript code inside the script tag!
  const button1 = document.querySelector('.submit1')
  button1.onclick = () => {
    alert('Ouch!') // alert will display a popup when button is clicked
  }
</script>
```

**Exercise:** Create an HTML page with a button that reads 'House Lannister'.
When you click on the button, alert `"Winter is coming"` two times.
[Live example](https://songz.c0d3.com/js1/lanister.html)

<Spoiler>

Add a button and script tag.

Select the button element, and set the button's `onclick` property to a
function.

When the button is clicked (onclick event is run), run the alert function twice.

```html
<button class="winter">House Lannister</button>
<hr />
<script>
  const button1 = document.querySelector('.winter')
  button1.onclick = () => {
    alert('Winter is coming')
    alert('Winter is coming')
  }
</script>
```

</Spoiler>

## Value property

Input elements have a `value` property that you can use to get the value of
whatever the user typed in.

Here is an example of how to show what the user has typed in the first input
element. See if you can add this to your `challenge1.html` file.

```jsx
const inputButton = document.querySelector('.submit1')
const firstInput = document.querySelector('.input1')
inputButton.onclick = () => {
  // this function runs when user clicks on the button
  alert(firstInput.value)
}
```

**Note:** You may notice that the input value is a string. To change it into a
number, you can add an unary operator `+` in front of the string:
`alert(+firstInput.value)`.

```jsx
const inputButton = document.querySelector('.submit1')
const firstInput = document.querySelector('.input1')
const secondInput = document.querySelector('.input2')
inputButton.onclick = () => {
  // this function runs when user clicks on the button
  const firstInputValue = +firstInput.value
  const secondInputValue = +secondInput.value
  alert(firstInputValue + secondInputValue)
}
```

**Note**: You can also set or change the input element's value! Here is a
example: (remember that `=` means the left side stores the value of the right
side)

```jsx
const inputButton = document.querySelector('.submit1')
const firstInput = document.querySelector('.input1')
inputButton.onclick = () => {
  // this function runs when user clicks on the button
  const val = +firstInput.value
  firstInput.value = val > 10
}
```

**Debugging** - If your page is not doing what you want it to do, you can look
at the `console`. This is where the browser will try to tell you where and what
the error is if you've written your code in a way it can't understand.
[Read this](/docs/setup#running-html-codes-on-the-browser) to learn how to open
the browser's console.

To solve this - First write down the steps. Compare your steps with the answer.
Then write the code.

1. [Create an HTML page](https://songz.c0d3.com/js0/2.html) with an input box
   and a button. When you click on the button, if the input value is divisible
   by 2, set the value (contents) of the input box to 0. Otherwise, do nothing.

<Spoiler>

1. Add input and button tags
2. When you click on the button, your `onclick` function should do this:
   1. Get value from input element
   2. If the value is even, change the input element's value property to `0`

</Spoiler>

2. [Create a UI (user interface) for JS0 challenge 1](https://songz.c0d3.com/js0/3.html) -
   Add 2 input boxes and a button. When you click on the button, use alert to
   display the sum of the values in the 2 input boxes. **Hint:** We've been
   working on this in the examples!

<Spoiler>

1. Add 2 input and button tags. You may want to give them class attributes.
2. Get the elements.
3. When you click on the button, `onclick` function should do this:
   - Get values from input elements (make sure to convert them to numbers!)
   - Use alert to display the sum of value1 + value2

</Spoiler>

3. [Create a UI for JS1 challenge 2](https://songz.c0d3.com/js0/4.html) - Add an
   input box and a button. When you click on the button, use alert to display
   "Big" if the input number is greater than 5. Otherwise, nothing happens.

<Spoiler>

1. Add input and button tags. Select the elements.
2. When you click on the button, `onclick` function should do this:
   - Get the value from input element (make sure to convert it to a number)
   - if the number is greater than 5, run the `alert` function!

</Spoiler>

4. [Create a UI for JS0 challenge 7](https://songz.c0d3.com/js0/5.html) - Add 2
   input boxes and a button. When you click on the button, use alert to display
   true if the sum of the 2 inputs is greater than 10. Otherwise, display false.

<Spoiler>

1. Add 2 input and button tags. You may want to give them class attributes.
2. Get the elements
3. When you click on the button, `onclick` function should do this:
   - Get values from input elements (make sure to convert them to numbers!)
   - Run alert and pass in: sum of the values is greater than 10 → This will be
     a boolean

</Spoiler>

5. [Create a UI for JS0 challenge 8](https://songz.c0d3.com/js0/6.html) - Add 2
   input boxes and 2 buttons (call them 'Generate' and 'Submit'). When the
   'Generate' button is clicked, the function solution (for challenge 8) runs
   and a function is returned. When 'Submit' button is clicked, run the returned
   function and use alert to display its result.

<Spoiler name = "Hint">
Recall that challenge 8 takes in 2 numbers, and returns a function that returns the sum of the 2 numbers when the function is executed.

Example

```jsx
const a = solution(5, 6) // a is a function, and a() will return 11
```

Your 2 buttons will each have different `onclick` behavior. The Generate
button's `onclick` function should run the function solution and store the
returned function in a variable that can be used later.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name = "Overview">

1. (look at hint above) Create a `solution` function that takes in 2 numbers and
   returns a function
2. Create a variable (ie `runFun` ) - We will use this to store the result of
   the `solution` function.
3. Add 2 input and 2 button tags. You may want to give them class attributes.
4. Get the elements
5. When the generate button is clicked, the `onclick` function should do this:
   - get 2 values from input elements (make sure to convert them to numbers!)
   - Run `solution` function and pass in the 2 values as arguments. Store the
     returned value into `runFun`
6. When the submit button is clicked, the `onclick` function should do this:
   - Run the `runFun` function. Alert the result.

</Spoiler>
<Spoiler name = "Debrief">
The solutions have been similar up till now; they all got a result from running a function and displayed it immediately. This time, we had to get a result and store it until another button was clicked. The browser will store and remember JavaScript variables until the page is reloaded—but they have to be declared or defined in the right place!

View the source for the exercise. Notice how we inserted `let fun1` in the
middle of the `<script>`, right before defining gb's `onclick` function. This
declares the `fun1` variable (it's OK that we didn't assign it any value) as a
global variable since the declaration is outside of the `onclick` function and
the variable fun1 will still exist after that function has completed running.
What would happen if you only had `let fun1 = solution(+v1, +v2)` inside the
function?

6. [Create a UI for JS0 challenge 9](https://songz.c0d3.com/js0/7.html) - Create
   2 input boxes and one button (call it 'Generate'). When the Generate button
   is clicked, run the function solution (for challenge 9) and a function is
   returned. Add a 3rd input box and another button (call it 'Submit'). When the
   Submit button is clicked, run the returned function with the third input and
   alert the result.

<Spoiler name = 'Overview'>

1. (Challenge 9) Create a `solution` function that takes in 2 numbers and
   returns a function
2. Create a variable (ie `runFun` ) - We will use this to store the result of
   the `solution` function.
3. Create 3 input and 2 button tags. You may want to give them class attributes.
4. Get the elements
5. When the generate button is clicked, the `onclick` function should do this:
   - get 2 values from input elements (make sure to convert them to numbers!)
   - Run `solution` function and pass in the 2 values as arguments. Store the
     returned value into `runFun`
6. When the submit button is clicked, the `onclick` function should do this:
   - Get the value from the 3rd input element (make sure to convert it to a
     number)
   - Run the `runFun` function and pass in the value as an argument. Alert the
     result.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler name = "Help">
For Challenge 9, write a function that takes in 2 numbers, and returns another function that takes in a number and returns the sum of all 3 numbers when called.

Example

```jsx
const a = solution(1, 2) // a is a function
// a(1) returns 4 because 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
// a(5) returns 8 because 1 + 2 + 5 = 8
