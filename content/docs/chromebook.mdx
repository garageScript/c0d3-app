In order to install nodejs on a chromebook you must have linux enabled. If you
do not have linux enabled on your computer please follow the steps outlined
below.

- On the bottom left, click on the Launch button
- Type in Settings
- Click on Settings or press enter to open it
- On the left panel click on Linux (Beta)
- Click Turn On
- Click Install

Note: You can also get to the Settings section by selecting time on the bottom
right and clicking on Settings.

Once Linux has been successfully installed, the terminal should open up
automatically (if not, navigate to it by searching in the app Launcher). Check
for any updates by typing

`sudo apt update`

Update any packages that need to be upgrated by typing

`sudo apt upgrade`

## Step 2 Install nodejs

You need to install NVM (Node Virtual Manager) before you can install nodejs.
Follow the steps listed below.

### Install NVM

- Got to the github repo for NVM
  - [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Scroll down to the Table of Contents and click on Install and Upgrade Script
- Copy and paste the cURL command in the terminal, then press enter.

### Install nodejs

Note: Depending on when you are reading this, you may need to install a later
version of node. As of this example, node 10 will be installed.

- In the terminal type: `nvm i 14`

Once all these is done, you should have node and npm installed. Type in
`node -v` to double check.
