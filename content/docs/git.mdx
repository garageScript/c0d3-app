## Git Overview

Git is a version control system. Imagine working on a codebase with 3 engineers,
(A,B,C)

3:00pm → A updates code with new feature

3:15pm → B updates code with new feature

3:16pm → A updates code with new feature

4:20pm → C updates code with new feature

5:00pm → You notice that your users are complaining about bugs in your app.

With git or other version control systems, upon noticing the bug you can revert
the code to 4:20pm, 3:16pm, 3:15pm, or anytime in history to find a place where
there is no bugs. Problem solved!

(This example is overly simplified)

## Codebase

Treat the curriculum like you have joined a new company and working on a new
codebase. The first thing you should do is to download it onto your machine. To
do this, you need to run `git clone url-to-codebase`. For C0D3 curriculum, the
url is
[https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum](https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum)

After downloading the codebase, you should run `git status` to see which branch
you are on, which will be `master`. `Master` branch will be where your most
perfect code live (after getting reviewed), so you do not want to make any code
changes on this branch. Instead, you should create a new branch.

## Branches

Treat each problem like a new feature in the codebase. To start problem one, you
want to create a new branch called `p1` (which stands for problem 1). To do
this, run `git checkout -b p1` . After this, run `git status` to make sure you
are indeed on p1 branch.

## Commits

After solving problem 1 and passing all the tests, you should feel confident to
save your code changes. To do this, there are 2 steps:

`git add filename` → Add all the files that you want to commit (aka save
changes). If you are unsure of the files you have changed, run `git status` .

`git commit -m 'your message here'` → When you save your changes, it is
necessary to describe what your changes are. This way, in the future you can
read the history of commit messages to understand at a high level all the
changes that happened.

`git log` → This commands display the history of commit messages. In this mode,
use the arrow keys to scroll up and down and press `q` to return to the command
prompt.

If a typo is discovered in your latest commit, use `git commit --amend` to
correct the typo.

## Starting a new feature / problem

After submitting a problem, you might be tempted to immediately start working on
the next feature. This is not good. It is bad practice to submit 2 features
together. Here is the correct way to start a new problem / feature:

1. Go back to master branch (which does not have your solution to problem 1)
   1. `git checkout master`
2. From master branch, create a new branch (ie: p2)
   1. `git checkout -b p2`

## Summary:

- `git clone url` to download a codebase
- `git checkout -b branchname` to create a new branch
- `git checkout branchname` to switch to existing branch
- `git status` to view your current branch and the files that are changed
- `git log` to view commit message history
- `git commit --amend` to edit the latest commit message
- Commit!
  - `git add filename` to add the file you want to save
  - `git commit -m 'message here'` to save your changes and write a meaning
    message to describe your change

# Common submission issues

<br />

## Multiple solutions in a branch?

First, figure out which branch is the culprit. `git checkout p1` to switch
branches

Run `git diff master` to see what will be submitted. This compares the changes
between the current branch and master. If everything looks good (only changes in
one file), switch to a different branch and run the diff command again.

Once you have found the bad branch, the easiest solution is to delete the branch
and submit again (if you've done it before, you can do it again!). To delete the
branch, first go to master: `git checkout master`, then delete the offending
branch: `git branch -D your_offending_branch_name`.

Now, from master, you can create a new branch
`git checkout -b whateverBranchItWas` and then continue normally.
