# Division and Mod

While you're probably already comfortable with division, this might be your
first encounter with the modulo operation. The modulo operation is used to find
the remainder after division. In JavaScript the modulo operator is denoted with
a percent sign %.

A quick example - dividing 10 by 6:

- Since 6 goes into 10 once, 10 / 6 gives us 1 and a remainder of 4
- The modulo operation, 10 % 6 gives us that remainder of 4
