              When you finish your lesson, you will have the opportunity to help new students who are starting the lesson. By code reviewing students to the same standard that you were code reviewed, you help ensure that new students are writing good code and becoming better engineers. At the same time, conducting regular code reviews helps you improve your ability to read/debug code as well as understand the lesson concepts at a deeper level.
